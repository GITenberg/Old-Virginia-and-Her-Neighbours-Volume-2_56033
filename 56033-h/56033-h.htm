country. In Virginia “there is nothing wanting”
to make people happy; there are “plenty, health,
and wealth.” Of English about 15,000 are settled
there, with 300 negro servants. Of kine,
oxen, bulls, and calves, there are 20,000,
and there is plenty of good butter and
cheese. There are 200 horses, 50 asses, 3,000
sheep with good wool, 5,000 goats, and swine and
poultry innumerable. Besides these European
animals, there are many deer, with “rackoons, as
good meat as lamb,” and “passonnes” [opossums],
otters and beavers, foxes and dogs that
“bark not.” In the waters are “above thirty
sorts” of fish “very excellent good in their kinds.”
The wild turkey sometimes weighs sixty pounds,
and besides partridges, ducks, geese, and pigeons,
the woods abound in sweet songsters and “most
rare coloured parraketoes, and [we have] one bird
we call the mock-bird; for he will imitate all other
birds’ notes and cries, both day and night birds,
yea, the owls and nightingales.”</p>

<div id="Agriculture" class="sidenote">Agriculture.</div>

<p>The farmers have under cultivation many hundred
acres of excellent wheat; their maize, or
“Virginia corn,” yields an increase of 500 for 1,
and makes “good bread and furmity”
[porridge]; they have barley in plenty,
and six brew-houses which brew strong and well-flavoured
beer. There are fifteen kinds of fruit
that for delicacy rival the fruits of Italy; in the
gardens grow potatoes, turnips, carrots, parsnips,
onions, artichokes, asparagus, beans, and better
peas than those of England, with all manner of
herbs and “physick flowers.” The tobacco is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
everywhere “much vented and esteemed,” but
such immense crops are raised that the price is
but three pence a pound. There is also a hope
that indigo, hemp and flax, vines and silk-worms,
can be cultivated with profit, since it is chiefly
hands that are wanted. It surely would be better
to grow silk here, where mulberry trees are so
plenty, than to fetch it as we do from Persia and
China “with great charge and expense and hazard,”
thereby enriching “heathen and Mahumetans.”</p>

<div id="Northwest_passage" class="sidenote">Northwest passage.</div>

<p>At the same time they are hoping soon to discover
a way to China, “for Sir Francis Drake was
on the back side of Virginia in his voyage about
the world in 37 degrees ... and now
all the question is only how broad the
land may be to that place [<i>i. e.</i> California] from
the head of James River above the falls.” By
prosecuting discovery in this direction “the planters
in Virginia shall gain the rich trade of the
East India, and so cause it to be driven through
the continent of Virginia, part by land and part
by water, and in a most gainful way and safe, and
far less expenseful and dangerous, than now it is.”</p>

<div id="Commercial_rivals" class="sidenote">Commercial

<p>It behooves the English, says our pamphlet, to
be more vigilant, and to pay more heed to their
colonies; for behold, “the Swedes have come and
crept into a river called Delawar, that is within
the limits of Virginia,” and they are driving “a
great and secret trade of furs.” Moreover,
“the Hollanders have stolen into
a river called Hudson’s River, in the limits also of
Virginia, ... they have built a strong fort ...
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
and drive a trade of fur there with the natives for
above £10,000 a year. These two plantations are
... on our side of Cape Cod which parts us and
New England. Thus are the English nosed in all
places, and out-traded by the Dutch. They would
not suffer the English to use them so; but they
have vigilant statesmen, and advance all they can
for a common good, and will not spare any encouragements
to their people to discover.”</p>

<p>“Concerning New England,” which is but four

but except for the fishing, “there is not much in
that land,” which in respect of frost and
snow is as Scotland compared with England,
and so barren withal that, “except a herring
be put into the hole that you set the corn or maize
in, it will not come up.” What a pity that the
New England people, “being now about 20,000,
did not seat themselves at first to the south of
Virginia, in a warm and rich country, where their
industry would have produced sugar, indigo, ginger,
cotton, and the like commodities!” But here
in Virginia the land “produceth, with very great
increase, whatsoever is committed into the bowels
of it; ... a fat rich soil everywhere watered
with many fine springs, small rivulets, and wholesome
waters.” As to healthiness, fewer people die
in a year proportionately than in England; “since
that men are provided with all necessaries, have
plenty of victual, bread, and good beer,
... all which the Englishman loves full
dearly.” Nor is their spiritual welfare
neglected, for there are twenty churches, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
“doctrine and orders after the church of England;”
and “the ministers’ livings are esteemed
worth at least £100 per annum; they are paid by
each planter so much tobacco per poll, and so
many bushels of corn; they live all in peace and
love.”</p>

<div id="Rapid_growth_of_population" class="sidenote">Rapid

<p>It will be observed that Captain Mathews possessed,
in his forty black servants, nearly one
seventh part of the negro population. Of the conditions
under which wholesale negro slavery grew
up, I shall treat hereafter. In the third quarter
of the seventeenth century it was still in its beginnings.
Between 1650 and 1670, along with an
extraordinary growth in the total population,
we observe a marked increase in
the number of black slaves. In the latter
year Berkeley estimated the population at
32,000 free whites, 6,000 indentured white servants,
and 2,000 negroes. Large estates, cultivated
by wholesale slave labour, were coming into
existence, and a peculiar type of aristocratic or
in some respects patriarchal society was growing
up in Virginia. It was still for the most part
confined to the peninsula between the James and
York rivers and the territory to the south of the
former, from Nansemond as far as the Appomattox,
although in Gloucester likewise there was a
considerable population, and there were settlements
in Middlesex and Lancaster counties, on
opposite banks of the Rappahannock, and even as
far as Northumberland and Westmoreland on the
Potomac. In the course of the disputes over
Kent Island, settlements began upon those shores
and increased apace.</p>

<div id="Names_of_Virginia_counties" class="sidenote">Names of
Virginia
counties.</div>

<p>Some significant history is fossilized in the
names of Virginia counties. When they are not
the old shire names imported from England, like
those just mentioned, they are apt to be personal
names indicating the times when the counties were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
first settled, or when they acquired a distinct existence
as counties. For a long time
such personal names were chiefly taken
from the royal household. Thus, while
Charles City County bears the name of Charles I.,
bestowed upon the region before that king ascended
the throne, the portion of it south of
James River, set off in 1702 as Prince George
County, was named for George of Denmark, consort
of Queen Anne. So King William County on
the south bank of the Mattapony, and King and
Queen County on its north bank, carry us straight
to the times of William and Mary, and indicate
the position of the frontier in the days of Charles
II.; while to the west of them the names of Hanover
and the two Hanoverian princesses, Caroline
and Louisa, carry us on to the days of the first
two Georges.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> At the time with which our narrative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
is now concerned, all that region to the south
of Spottsylvania was unbroken wilderness. In
1670 a careful estimate was made of the number
of Indians comprised within the immediate neighbourhood
of the colony, and there were counted up
725 warriors, of whom more than 400 were on the
Appomattox and Pamunkey frontiers, and nearly
200 between the Potomac and Rappahannock.</p>

<div id="Scarcity_of_royalist_names" class="sidenote">Scarcity of
royalist
names on
the map of
New England.</div>

<p>The map of Virginia, in the light in which I
have here considered it, shows one remarkable
point of contrast with the map of New England.
On the coast of the latter one finds a very few
names commemorative of royalty, such as Charles
River, named by Captain John Smith, Cape Anne,
named by Charles I. when Prince of
Wales, and the Elizabeth Islands, named
by Captain Gosnold still earlier and in
the lifetime of the great Queen. But
when it comes to names given by the settlers
themselves, one cannot find in all New England a
county name taken from any English sovereign or
prince, except Dukes for the island of Martha’s
Vineyard, and that simply recalls the fact that
the island once formed a part of the proprietary
domain of James, Duke of York, and sent a delegate
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
to the first legislature that assembled at
Manhattan. Except for this one instance, we
should never know from the county names of
New England that such a thing as kingship had
ever existed. As for names of towns, there is in
Massachusetts a Lunenburg, which is said to have
received its name at the suggestion of a party of
travellers from England in the year 1726;<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> it
was afterward copied in Vermont; and by diligently
searching the map of New England we
may find half a dozen Hanovers and Brunswicks,
counting originals and copies. Between this showing
and that of Virginia, where the sequence of
royal names is full enough to preserve a rude
record of the country’s expansion, the contrast is
surely striking. The difference between the Puritan
temper and that of the Cavaliers seems to be
written ineffaceably upon the map.</p>

in Virginia:
some

<div id="Some_democratic_protests" class="sidenote">Some democratic

<p>We are thus brought to the question as to how
far the Cavalier element predominated in the composition
of Old Virginia. It is a subject concerning
which current general statements are
apt to be loose and misleading. It has
given rise to much discussion, and, like
a good deal of what passes for historical
discussion, it has too often been conducted under
the influence of personal or sectional prejudices.
Half a century ago, in the days when the people
of the slave states and those of the free states
found it difficult to think justly or to speak kindly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
of one another, one used often to hear sweeping
generalizations. On the one hand, it was said that
Southerners were the descendants of Cavaliers,
and therefore presumably of gentle blood, while
Northerners were descendants of Roundheads, and
therefore presumably of ignoble origin. Some
such notion may have prompted the famous remark
of Robert Toombs, in 1860: “We [<i>i. e.</i>
the Southerners] are the gentlemen of this country.”
On the other hand, it was retorted that the
people of the South were in great part descended
from indentured white servants sent from the jails
and slums of England.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a> This point will receive
due attention in a future chapter. At present we
may note that descent from Cavaliers has not
always been a matter of pride with Southern
speakers and writers. There was a time when the
fierce spirit of democracy was inclined to regard
such a connection as a stigma. The father of
President Tyler “used to say that he cared naught
for any other ancestor than Wat Tyler the blacksmith,
who had asserted the rights of oppressed
humanity, and that he would have no other device
on his shield than a sledge hammer raised in the
act of striking.”<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> On the subject of
Cavaliers a well known Virginian writer,
Hugh Blair Grigsby, once grew very
warm. “The Cavalier,” said he, “was essentially a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
slave, a compound slave, a slave to the King and
a slave to the Church. I look with contempt on
the miserable figment which seeks to trace the
distinguishing points of the Virginia character to
the influence of those butterflies of the British aristocracy.”<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a>
Historical questions are often treated
in this way. We grow up with a vague conception
of something in the past which we feel in duty
bound to condemn, and then if we are told that
our own forefathers were part and parcel of the
hated thing we lose our tempers. Mr. Grigsby’s
remarks are an expression of American feeling in
what may be called its Elijah Pogram period,
when the knowledge of history was too slender
and the historic sense too dull to be shocked at
the incongruity of classing such men as Strafford
and Falkland with “butterflies.” The study of
history in such a mood is not likely to be fruitful
of much beside rhetoric.</p>

<div id="Sweeping_statements" class="sidenote">Sweeping
statements
are inadmissible.</div>

<p>Before we proceed, a few further words are
desirable concerning the fallacies and misconceptions
which abound in the opinions cited in the
foregoing paragraph. It is impossible to make
any generalization concerning the origin of the
white people of the South as a whole, or of the
North as a whole, further than to say
that their ancestors came from Europe,
and a large majority of them from the
British islands. The facts are too complicated to
be embraced in any generalization more definitely
limited than this. When sweeping statements are
made about “the North” and “the South,” it is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
often apparent that the speaker has in mind only
Massachusetts and tidewater Virginia, making
these parts do duty for the whole. The present
book will make it clear that it is only in connection
with tidewater Virginia that the migration
of Cavaliers from England to America has
any historical significance.</p>

<div id="Difference_between_Cavaliers" class="sidenote">Difference
between
Cavaliers
and Roundheads
was
political, not
social.</div>

<p>It is a mistake to suppose that the contrast
between Cavaliers and Roundheads was in any
wise parallel with the contrast between high-born
people and low-born. A majority of the landed
gentry, titled and untitled, supported Charles I.,
while the chief strength of the Parliament lay in
the smaller landholders and in the merchants of
the cities. But the Roundheads also included
a large and powerful minority of
the landed aristocracy, headed by the
Earls of Bedford, Warwick, Manchester,
Northumberland, Stamford, and
Essex, the Lords Fairfax and Brooke, and many
others. The leaders of the party, Pym and Hampden,
Vane and Cromwell, were of gentle blood;
and among the officers of the New Model were
such as Montagues, Pickerings, Fortescues, Sheffields,
and Sidneys. In short, the distinction between
Cavalier and Roundhead was no more a
difference in respect of lineage or social rank than
the analogous distinction between Tory and Whig.
The mere fact of a man’s having belonged to the
one party or the other raises no presumption as to
his “gentility.”</p>

<div id="Importance_of_the_middle_class" class="sidenote">Importance

<p>It is worth while here to correct another error
which is quite commonly entertained in the United
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
States. It is the error of supposing that in Great
Britain there are distinct orders of society, or that
there exists anything like a sharp and
well defined line between the nobility
and the commonalty. The American
reader is apt to imagine a “peerage,” the members
of which have from time immemorial constituted
a kind of caste clearly marked off from the
great body of the people, and into which it has
always been very difficult for plain people to rise.
In this crude conception the social differences
between England and America are greatly exaggerated.
In point of fact the British islands are
the one part of Europe where the existence of a
peerage has not resulted in creating a distinct
upper class of society. The difference will be
most clearly explained by contrasting England
with France. In the latter country, before the
Revolution of 1789, there was a peerage consisting
of great landholders, local rulers and magistrates,
and dignitaries of the church, just as in
England. But in France all the sons
and brothers of a peer were nobles distinguished
by a title and reckoned among the peerage,
and all were exempt from sundry important
political duties, including the payment of taxes.
Thus they constituted a real <i>noblesse</i>, or caste
apart from the people, until the Revolution at a
single blow destroyed all their privileges. At the
present day French titles of nobility are merely
courtesy titles, and through excessive multiplication
have become cheap. On the other hand, in
England, the families of peers have never been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
exempt from their share of the public burdens.
The “peerage,” or hereditary right to sit in the
House of Lords, belongs only to the head of the
family; all the other members of the family are
commoners, though some may be addressed by
courtesy titles. During the formative period of
modern political society, from the fourteenth century
onward, the sons of peers habitually competed
for seats in the House of Commons, side by side
with merchants and yeomen. This has prevented
anything like a severance between the interests
of the higher and of the lower classes in England,
and has had much to do with the peaceful and
healthy political development which has so eminently
characterized our mother country. England
has never had a <i>noblesse</i>. As the upper class has
never been sharply distinguished politically, so it
has not held itself separate socially. Families
with titles have intermarried with families that
have none, the younger branches of a peer’s family
become untitled gentry, ancient peerages lapse
while new ones are created, so that there is a
“circulation of gentle blood” that has thus far
proved eminently wholesome. More than two
thirds of the present House of Lords are the
grandsons or great-grandsons of commoners. Of
the 450 or more hereditary peerages now existing,
three date from the thirteenth century and four
from the fourteenth; of those existing in the days
of Thomas Becket not one now remains
in the same family. It has always been
easy in England for ability and character
to raise their possessor in the social scale;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
and hence the middle class has long been recognized
as the abiding element in England’s strength.
Voltaire once compared the English people to
their ale,&mdash;froth at the top and dregs at the bottom,
but sound and bright and strong in the middle.
As to the last he was surely right.</p>

<div id="Respect_for_industry_in_England" class="sidenote">Respect paid
to industry
in England.</div>

<p>One further point calls for mention. In mediæval
and early modern England, great respect was
paid to incorporated crafts and trades.
The influence and authority wielded by
county magnates over the rural population
was paralleled by the power exercised in the
cities by the livery companies or guilds. Since
the twelfth century, the municipal franchise in the
principal towns and cities of Great Britain has
been for the most part controlled by the various
trade and craft guilds. In the seventeenth century,
when the migrations to America were beginning,
it was customary for members of noble
families to enter these guilds as apprentices in the
crafts of the draper, the tailor, the vintner, or the
mason, etc. Many important consequences have
flowed from this. Let it suffice here to note that
this fact of the rural aristocracy keeping in touch
with the tradesmen and artisans has been one of
the safeguards of English liberty; it has been one
source of the power of the Commons, one check
upon the undue aspirations of the Crown. It
indicates a kind of public sentiment very different
from that which afterward grew up in our
southern states under the malignant influence of
slavery, which proclaimed an antagonism between
industry and gentility that is contrary to the whole
spirit of English civilization.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<div id="The_Cavalier_exodus" class="sidenote">The Cavalier
exodus.</div>

<p>With these points clear in our minds, we may
understand the true significance of the arrival of
the Cavaliers in Virginia. The date to be remembered
in connection with that event is 1649, and
it is instructive to compare it with the exodus of
Puritans to New England. The little
settlement of the Mayflower Pilgrims
was merely a herald of the great Puritan exodus,
which really began in 1629, when Charles I. entered
upon his period of eleven years of rule
without a parliament, and continued until about
1642, when the Civil War broke out. During
those thirteen years more than 20,000 Puritans
came to New England. The great Cavalier exodus
began with the king’s execution in 1649, and
probably slackened after 1660. It must have been
a chief cause of the remarkable increase of the
white population of Virginia from 15,000 in 1649
to 38,000 in 1670.</p>

<div id="Political_complexion_of_Virginia_before_1649" class="sidenote">Political

before 1649.</div>

<div id="The_great_exchange_of_1649" class="sidenote">The great
exchange of
1649.</div>

<p>The period of the Commonwealth in England
thus marks an important epoch in Virginia, and
we must be on our guard against confusing what
came after with what preceded it. As
to the political complexion of Virginia
in the earliest time, it would be difficult
to make a general statement, except that there
was a widespread feeling in favour of the Company
as managed by Sandys and Southampton. This
meant that the settlers knew when they were well
governed. They did not approve of a party that
sent an Argall to fleece them, even though it were
the court party. So, too, in the thrusting out of
Sir John Harvey in 1635 we see the temper of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
the councillors and burgesses flatly opposed to
the king’s unpopular representative. But such
instances do not tell us much concerning the attitude
of the colonists upon questions of English
politics. The fortunes of the Puritan settlers in
Virginia afford a surer indication. At first, as
we have seen, when the Puritans as a body had
not yet separated from the Church, there were a
good many in Virginia; and by 1640 they probably
formed about seven per cent. of the population.
The legislation against them beginning in
1631 seems to indicate that public sentiment in
Virginia favoured the policy of Laud; while the
slackness with which such legislation was enforced
raises a suspicion that such sentiment was at first
not very strong. It seems probable that as the
country party in England came more and more
completely under the control of Puritanism, and
as Puritanism grew more and more radical in temper,
the reaction toward the royalist side grew
more and more pronounced in Virginia. If there
ever was a typical Cavalier of the more narrow-minded
sort, it was Sir William Berkeley, who at
the same time was by no means the sort of person
that one might properly call a “butterfly.” If
the eloquent Mr. Grigsby had once got into those
iron clutches, he would have sought some other
term of comparison. When Berkeley arrived in
Virginia, and for a long time afterward, he was
extremely popular. We have seen him
acting with so much energy against the
Puritans that in the course of the year
1649 not less than 1,000 of them left the colony.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
Upon the news of the king’s death, Berkeley sent
a message to England inviting royalists to come
to Virginia, and within a twelvemonth perhaps
as many as 1,000 had arrived, picked men and
women of excellent sort. Thus it curiously happened
that the same moment which saw Virginia
lose most of her Puritan population, also saw it
replaced by an equal number of devoted Cavaliers.</p>

<div id="Moderation_shown_in_Virginia" class="sidenote">Moderation
shown in
Virginia.</div>

<p>From this moment we may date the beginnings
of Cavalier ascendency in Virginia. But for the
next ten years that growing ascendency was qualified
by the necessity of submitting to the Puritan
government in England. In 1652 Berkeley was
obliged to retire from the governorship,
and the king’s men in Virginia found it
prudent to put some restraint upon the
expression of their feelings. But in this change,
as we have seen, there was no violence. It is probable
that there was a considerable body of colonists
“comparatively indifferent to the struggle of
parties in England, anxious only to save Virginia
from spoliation and bloodshed, and for that end
willing to throw in their lot with the side whose
success held out the speediest hopes of peace.
There is another consideration which helps to
explain the moderation of the combatants. In
England each party was exasperated by grievous
wrongs, and hence its hour of triumph was also its
hour of revenge. The struggle in Virginia was
embittered by no such recollections.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></p>

“a man of good stature, comely visage, an enterprising
genius, a sound head, vigorous
spirit, and generous nature,”<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> qualities
that may be recognized in many of his famous
descendants. This Richard Lee belonged to an
ancient family, the Lees of Coton Hall, in Shropshire,
whom we find from the beginning of the
thirteenth century in positions of honour and
trust. He came to Virginia about 1642, and
obtained that year an estate which he called Paradise,
near the head of Poropotank Creek, on the
York River. He was from the first a man of
much importance in the colony, serving as justice,
burgess, councillor, and secretary of state. In
1654 we find him described as “faithful and useful
to the interests of the Commonwealth,” but, as
Dr. Edmund Lee says, “it is only fair to observe
that this claim was made for him by a friend in
his absence;”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> or perhaps it only means that he
was not one of the tribe of fanatics who love
to kick against the pricks.<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Certain it is that
Colonel Lee was no Puritan, though doubtless he
submitted loyally to the arrangement of 1652, as
so many others did. There was nothing for the
king’s men to do but possess their souls in quiet
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
until 1659, when news came of the resignation of
Richard Cromwell. “Worthy Captain Mathews,”
whom the assembly had chosen governor, died
about the same time. Accordingly, in March,
1660, the assembly resolved that, since
there was then in England no resident
sovereign generally recognized, the supreme
power in Virginia must be regarded as
lodged in the assembly, and that all writs should
issue in the name of the Grand Assembly of Virginia
until such a command should come from
England as the assembly should judge to be lawful.
Having passed this resolution, the assembly
showed its political complexion by electing Sir
William Berkeley for governor: and in the same
breath it revealed its independent spirit by providing
that he must call an assembly at least once
in two years, and oftener if need be; and that he
must not dissolve it without the consent of a
majority of the members. On these terms Berkeley
accepted office at the hands of the assembly.</p>

<p>Before this transaction, perhaps in 1658, Colonel
Lee seems to have visited Charles II. at Brussels,
where he handed over to the still exiled prince the
old commission of Berkeley, and may
have obtained from him a new one for
future use, reinstating him as governor.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> There
is a vague tradition that on this occasion he asked
how soon Charles would be likely to be able to
protect the colony in case it should declare its
allegiance to him; and from this source may have
arisen the wild statement, recorded by Beverley
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
and promulgated by the eminent historian Robertson,
that Virginia proclaimed Charles II. as sovereign
a year or two before he was proclaimed in
England.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> The absurdity of this story was long
ago pointed out;<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> but since error has as many lives
as a cat, one may still hear it repeated.
Charles II. was proclaimed king in England
on the 8th of May, 1660, and in
Virginia on the 20th of September following.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> In
October the royal commission for Berkeley arrived,
and the governor may thus have felt that the conditions
on which he accepted his office from the
assembly were no longer binding. Our next chapter
will show how lightly he held them.</p>

<p>If one may judge from the public accounts of
York County in 1660, expressed in the arithmetic
of a tobacco currency, the 20th of September must
have been a joyful occasion:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>There can be no doubt that it was an occasion
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
prolific in legend. The historian Robert Beverley,
who was born about fifteen years afterward, tells
us that Governor Berkeley’s proclamation named
Charles II. as “King of England, Scotland,
France, Ireland, and Virginia.” The document
itself, however, calls him “our most gratious soveraigne,
Charles the Second, King of England,
Scotland, ffrance, &amp; Ireland,” and makes no mention
of Virginia.</p>

<div id="The_seal_of_Virginia" class="sidenote">The seal of
Virginia.</div>

<p>William Lee tells us that it was “in consequence
of this step” that the motto <i>En dat Virginia
quintam</i> was placed upon the seal of the
colony.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> Since “this step” was never taken, the
statement needs some qualification. The idea of
of designating Virginia as an additional
kingdom to those over which the English
sovereign ruled in Europe was already entertained
in 1590 by Edmund Spenser, who dedicated
his “Faëry Queene” to Elizabeth as queen of
“England, France,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> and Ireland, and of Virginia.”<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a>
As early as 1619 the London Company
adopted a coat-of-arms, upon which was the motto
<i>En dat Virginia quintum</i>, in which the unexpressed
noun is <i>regnum</i>; “Behold, Virginia gives
the fifth [kingdom].” After the restoration of
Charles II. a new seal for Virginia, adopted about
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
1663, has the same motto, the effect of which was
to rank Virginia by the side of his Majesty’s other
four dominions, England, Scotland, “France,”
and Ireland. We are told by the younger Richard
Henry Lee that in these circumstances originated
the famous epithet “Old Dominion.” In
1702, among several alterations in the seal, the
word <i>quintum</i> was changed to <i>quintam</i>, to agree
with the unexpressed noun <i>coronam</i>; “Behold,
Virginia gives the fifth [crown].” After the
legislative union of England with Scotland in
1707, another seal, adopted in 1714, substituted
<i>quartam</i> for <i>quintam</i>.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></p>

<div id="Increase_in_the_size_of_land_grants" class="sidenote">Increase in
the size of

<p>Just how many members of the royalist party
came to Virginia while their young king was off
upon his travels, it would be difficult to say. But
there were unquestionably a great many. We
have already remarked upon the very rapid increase
of white population, from about 15,000 in
1649 to 38,000 in 1670. Along with this
there was a marked increase in the size
of the land grants, both the average size
and the maximum; and in this coupling of facts
there is great significance, for they show that the
increase of population was predominantly an increase
in the numbers of the upper class, of the
people who could afford to have large estates. In
these respects the year 1650 marks an abrupt
change,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a> which may best be shown by a tabular

<p>The increase in the number of slaves after 1650
is a fact of similar import with the greater size of
the estates. All the circumstances agree in showing
that there was a large influx of eminently well-to-do
people. It is well known, moreover, who
these people were. It is in the reign of Charles II.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
that the student of Virginian history begins to meet
frequently with the familiar names, such
as Randolph, Pendleton, Madison, Mason,
Monroe, Cary, Ludwell, Parke, Robinson, Marshall,
Washington, and so many others that have
become eminent. All these were Cavalier families
that came to Virginia after the downfall of Charles
I. Whether President Tyler was right in claiming
descent from the Kentish rebel of 1381 is not
clear, but there is no doubt that his first American
ancestor, who came to Virginia after the battle of
Worcester, was a gentleman and a royalist.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> Until
recently there was some uncertainty as to the pedigree
of George Washington, but the researches
of Mr. Fitz Gilbert Waters of Salem have conclusively
proved that he was descended from
the Washingtons of Sulgrave, in Northamptonshire,
a family that had for generations
worthily occupied positions of honour and
trust. In the Civil War the Washingtons were
distinguished royalists. The commander who surrendered
Worcester in 1646 to the famous Edward
Whalley was Colonel Henry Washington;<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> and
his cousin John, who came to Virginia in 1657,
was great-grandfather of George Washington.
After the fashion that prevailed a hundred years
ago, the most illustrious of Americans felt little
interest in his ancestry; but with the keener historic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
sense and broader scientific outlook of the
present day, the importance of such matters is
better appreciated. <span id="The_pedigrees_of_horses_dogs">The pedigrees of horses, dogs</span>,
and fancy pigeons have a value that is quotable in
terms of hard cash. Far more important, for the
student of human affairs, are the pedigrees of men.
By no possible ingenuity of constitution-making or
of legislation can a society made up of ruffians
and boors be raised to the intellectual and moral
level of a society made up of well-bred merchants
and yeomen, parsons and lawyers. One
might as well expect to see a dray horse
win the Derby. It is, moreover, only when we
habitually bear in mind the threads of individual
relationship that connect one country with another,
that we get a really firm and concrete grasp of
history. Without genealogy the study of history
is comparatively lifeless. No excuse is needed,
therefore, for giving in this connection a tabulated
abridgment of the discoveries of Mr. Waters concerning
the forefathers of George Washington.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a>
Beside the personal interest attaching to everything
associated with that immortal name, this
pedigree has interest and value as being in large
measure typical. It is a fair sample of good
English middle-class pedigrees, and it is typical as
regards the ancestry of leading Cavalier families
in Virginia; an inspection of many genealogies of
those who came between 1649 and 1670 yields
about the same general impression. Moreover,
this pedigree is equally typical as regards the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
F<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
ancestry of leading Puritan families in New England.
The genealogies, for example, of Winthrop,
Dudley, Saltonstall, Chauncey, or Baldwin give
the same general impression as those of Randolph,
or Cary, or Cabell, or Lee. The settlers of Virginia
and of New England were opposed to each
other in politics, but they belonged to one and the
same stratum of society, and in their personal
characteristics they were of the same excellent
quality. To quote the lines of <span id="Sir_William_Jones_paraphrased">Sir William Jones</span>,

<div id="Importance_of_the_Cavalier_element_in_Virginia" class="sidenote">Importance
of the Cavalier
element
in Virginia.</div>

<p>There can be little doubt that these Cavaliers
were the men who made the greatness of Virginia.
To them it is due that her history represents ideas
and enshrines events which mankind will always
find interesting. It is apt to be the case that men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
who leave their country for reasons connected with
conscience and principle, men who have
once consecrated themselves to a cause,
are picked men for ability and character.
Such men are likely to exert upon any community
which they may enter an influence immeasurably
greater than an equal number of men
taken at random. It matters little what side they
may have espoused. Very few of the causes for
which brave men have fought one another have
been wholly right or wholly wrong. Our politics
may be those of Samuel Adams, but we must
admit that the Thomas Hutchinson type of mind
and character is one which society could ill afford
to lose. Of the gallant Cavaliers who drew the
sword for King Charles, there were many who no
more approved of his crooked methods and despotic
aims than Hutchinson approved of the
Stamp Act. No better illustration could be found
than Lord Falkland, some of whose kinsmen emigrated
to Virginia and played a conspicuous part
there. A proper combination of circumstances
was all that was required to bring the children
of these royalists into active political alliance with
the children of the Cromwellians.</p>

<div id="Differences_between_New_England_and_Virginia" class="sidenote">Differences
between
New England
and
Virginia.</div>

<p>Both in Virginia and in New England, then,
the principal element of the migration consisted
of picked men and women of the same station in
life, and differing only in their views of
civil and ecclesiastical polity. The differences
that grew up between the relatively
aristocratic type of society in
Virginia and the relatively democratic type in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
New England were due not at all to differences
in the social quality of the settlers, but in some
degree to their differences in church politics, and
in a far greater degree to the different economic
circumstances of Virginia and New England. It
is worth our while to point out some of these contrasts
and to indicate their effect upon the local
government, the nature of which, perhaps more
than anything else, determines the character of
the community as aristocratic or democratic.</p>

<div id="Settlement_of_New_England_by_congregations" class="sidenote">Settlement
of New England
by congregations.</div>

<p>That extreme Puritan theory of ecclesiastical
polity, according to which each congregation was to
be a little self-governing republic, had much to do
with the way in which New England was
colonized. The settlers came in congregations,
led by their favourite ministers,&mdash;such
men, for example, as Higginson and Cotton,
Hooker and Davenport. When such men,
famous in England for their bold preaching and
imperilled thereby, decided to move to America, a
considerable number of their parishioners would
decide to accompany them, and similarly minded
members of neighbouring churches would leave
their own pastor and join in the migration. Such
a group of people, arriving on the coast of Massachusetts,
would naturally select some convenient
locality, where they might build their houses near
together and all go to the same church.</p>

<div id="Land_grants_in_Massachusetts" class="sidenote">Land grants
in Massachusetts.</div>

<p>This migration, therefore, was a movement, not
of individuals or of separate families, but of
church-congregations, and it continued to be so as
the settlers made their way inland and westward.
The first river towns of Connecticut were thus
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
founded by congregations coming from Dorchester,
Cambridge, and Watertown. This
kind of settlement was favoured by the
government of Massachusetts, which
made grants of land, not to individuals but to
companies of people who wished to live together
and attend the same church.</p>

<div id="Small_farms" class="sidenote">Small farms.</div>

<p>It was also favoured by economic circumstances.
The soil of New England was not favourable to
the cultivation of great quantities of staple articles,
such as rice or tobacco, so that there was
nothing to tempt people to undertake extensive
plantations. Most of the people lived on small
farms, each family raising but little more than
enough food for its own support; and
the small size of the farms made it possible
to have a good many in a compact neighbourhood.
It appeared also that towns could be more
easily defended against the Indians than scattered
plantations; and this doubtless helped to keep
people together, although if there had been any
strong inducement for solitary pioneers to plunge
into the great woods, as in later years so often
happened at the West, it is not likely that any
dread of the savages would have hindered them.</p>

<div id="Township_and_village" class="sidenote">Township
and village.</div>

<p>Thus the early settlers of New England came
to live in townships. A township would consist of
about as many farms as could be disposed within
convenient distance from the meeting-house, where
all the inhabitants, young and old, gathered every
Sunday, coming on horseback or afoot.
The meeting-house was thus centrally
situated, and near it was the town pasture or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
“common,” with the school-house and the blockhouse,
or rude fortress for defence against the
Indians. For the latter building some commanding
position was apt to be selected, and hence we
so often find the old village streets of New England
running along elevated ridges or climbing
over beetling hilltops. Around the meeting-house
and common the dwellings gradually clustered into
a village, and after a while the tavern, store, and
town-house made their appearance.</p>

<div id="Social_position_of_settlers_in_New_England" class="sidenote">Social position
of settlers
in New
England.</div>

<p>Among the people who thus tilled the farms
and built up the villages of New England, the
differences in what we should call social position,
though noticeable, were not extreme. While in
England some had been esquires or country
magistrates, or “lords of the manor,”&mdash;a
phrase which does not mean a member
of the peerage, but a landed proprietor with
dependent tenants,&mdash;some had been yeomen, or
persons holding farms by some free kind of tenure;
some had been artisans or tradesmen in cities.
All had for many generations been more or less
accustomed to self-government and to public meetings
for discussing local affairs. That self-government,
especially as far as church matters were
concerned, they were stoutly bent upon maintaining
and extending. Indeed, that was what they
had crossed the ocean for. Under these circumstances
they developed a kind of government
which has remained practically unchanged down
to the present day. In the town meeting the government
is the entire adult male population. Its
merits, from a genuine democratic point of view,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
have long been recognized, but in these days of
rampant political quackery they are worth recalling
to mind, even at the cost of a brief digression.</p>

<div id="Some_merits_of_the_town_meeting" class="sidenote">Some merits
of the town
meeting.</div>

<div id="The_magic_fund_delusion" class="sidenote">The “magic
fund” delusion.</div>

<p>Within its proper sphere, government by town
meeting is the form of government most effectively
under watch and control. Everything is
done in the full daylight of publicity.
The specific objects for which public
money is to be appropriated are discussed in the
presence of everybody, and any one who disapproves
of any of these objects, or of the way in
which it is proposed to obtain it, has an opportunity
to declare his opinions. Under this form
of government people are not so liable to bewildering
delusions as under other forms. I refer
especially to the delusion that “the Government”
is a sort of mysterious power, possessed
of a magic inexhaustible fund of wealth,
and able to do all manner of things for
the benefit of “the People.” Some such notion
as this, more often implied than expressed, is very
common, and it is inexpressibly dear to demagogues.
It is the prolific root from which springs
that luxuriant crop of humbug upon which political
tricksters thrive as pigs fatten upon corn. In
point of fact no such government, armed with a
magic fund of its own, has ever existed upon the
earth. No government has ever yet used any
money for public purposes which it did not first
take from its own people,&mdash;unless when it may
have plundered it from some other people in victorious
warfare.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span></p>

<p>The inhabitant of a New England town is perpetually
reminded that “the Government” is “the
People.” Although he may think loosely about
the government of his state or the still more remote
government at Washington, he is kept pretty
close to the facts where local affairs are concerned,
and in this there is a political training of no small
value.</p>

<div id="Educational_value_of_the_town_meeting" class="sidenote">Educational
value of the
town meeting.</div>

<p>In the kind of discussion which it provokes, in
the necessity of facing argument with
argument and of keeping one’s temper
under control, the town meeting is the
best political training school in existence. Its
educational value is far higher than that of the
newspaper, which, in spite of its many merits as
a diffuser of information, is very apt to do its
best to bemuddle and sophisticate plain facts.
The period when town meetings were most important
from the wide scope of their transactions was
the period of earnest and sometimes stormy discussion
that ushered in our Revolutionary War.
In those days great principles of government were
discussed with a wealth of knowledge and stated
with masterly skill in town meeting.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div id="Primogeniture_and_entail_in_Virginia" class="sidenote">Primogeniture
and
entail in
Virginia.</div>

<p>In Virginia the economic circumstances were
very different from those of New England, and
the effects were seen in a different kind of local
institutions. In New England the system of small
holdings facilitated the change from primogeniture
to the Kentish custom of gavelkind, with
which many of the settlers were already familiar,
in which the property of an intestate is equally
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
divided among the children.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> In Virginia, on the
other hand, the large estates, cultivated
by servile labour, were kept together by
the combined customs of primogeniture
and entail, which lasted until they were overthrown
by Thomas Jefferson in 1776. In this circumstance,
more than in anything else, originated the
more aristocratic features in the local institutions
of Virginia. To this should be added the facts
that before the eighteenth century there was a
large servile class of whites, to which there was
nothing even remotely analogous in New England;
and that the introduction of negro slavery,
which was beginning to assume noticeable dimensions
about 1670, served to affix a stigma upon
manual labour.</p>

<div id="Virginia_parishes" class="sidenote">Virginia
parishes.</div>

<div id="The_vestry_a_close_corporation" class="sidenote">The vestry
a close
corporation.</div>

<p>In view of this group of circumstances we need
not wonder that in Old Virginia there were no
town meetings. The distances between plantations
coöperated with the distinction between
classes to prevent the growth of such an institution.
The English parish, with its
churchwardens and vestry and clerk,
was reproduced in Virginia under the same name,
but with some noteworthy peculiarities. If the
whole body of ratepayers had assembled in vestry
meeting, to enact by-laws and assess taxes, the
course of development would have been like that
of the New England town meeting. But instead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
of this the vestry, which exercised the chief authority
in the parish, was composed of twelve chosen
men. This was not government by a primary
assembly, it was representative government. At
first the twelve vestrymen were elected by the people
of the parish, and thus resembled the selectmen
of New England; but in 1662 “they obtained
the power of filling vacancies in
their own number,” so that they became
what is called a “close corporation,” and
the people had nothing to do with choosing them.
Strictly speaking, that was not representative government;
it was a step on the road that leads
towards oligarchical or despotic government. It
was, as we shall see, one of the steps ineffectually
opposed in Bacon’s rebellion.</p>

<div id="Powers_of_the_vestry" class="sidenote">Powers of
the vestry.</div>

<p>It was the vestry, thus constituted, that apportioned
the parish taxes, appointed the churchwardens,
presented the minister for induction into
office, and acted as overseers of the poor.
The minister presided in all vestry meetings.
His salary was paid in tobacco, and in 1696
it was fixed by law at 16,000 pounds of tobacco
yearly. In many parishes the churchwardens were
the collectors of the parish taxes. The other officers,
such as the sexton and the parish clerk, were
appointed either by the minister or by the vestry.</p>

<p>With the local government thus administered,
we see that the larger part of the people had little
directly to do. Nevertheless, in those small neighbourhoods
government could be kept in full sight
of the people, and so long as its proceedings went
on in broad daylight and were sustained by public
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
sentiment, all was well. As Jefferson said, “The
vestrymen are usually the most discreet farmers, so
distributed through the parish that every part of
it may be under the immediate eye of some one of
them. They are well acquainted with the details
and economy of private life, and they find sufficient
inducements to execute their charge well, in their
philanthropy, in the approbation of their neighbours,
and the distinction which that gives them.”<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></p>

<div id="The_county_was_the_unit_of_representation" class="sidenote">The county
was the unit
of representation.</div>

<p>The difference, however, between the New England
township and the Virginia parish, in respect
of self-government, was striking enough. We have
now to note a further difference. In New England,
the township was the unit of representation
in the colonial legislature; but in Virginia the
parish was not the unit of representation. The
county was that unit. In the colonial
legislature of Virginia the representatives
sat, not for parishes but for counties.
The difference is very significant. As the political
life of New England was in a manner built up out
of the political life of the towns, so the political
life of Virginia was built up out of the political
life of the counties. This was partly because the
vast plantations were not grouped about a compact
village nucleus like the small farms at the North,
and partly because there was not in Virginia that
Puritan theory of the church according to which
each congregation is a self-governing democracy.
The conditions which made the New England
town meeting were absent. The only alternative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
was some kind of representative government, and
for this the county was a small enough area. The
county in Virginia was much smaller than in
Massachusetts or Connecticut. In a few instances
the county consisted of only a single parish; in
some cases it was divided into two parishes, but
oftener into three or more.</p>

<div id="The_county_court_was_virtually_a_close_corporation" class="sidenote">The county
court was
virtually a
close corporation.</div>

<p>In Virginia, as in England and in New England,
the county was an area for the administration
of justice. There were usually in
each county eight justices of the peace,
and their court was the counterpart of
the quarter sessions in England. They
were appointed by the governor, but it was customary
for them to nominate candidates for the
governor to appoint, so that practically the court
filled its own vacancies and was a close corporation,
like the parish vestry. Such an arrangement
tended to keep the general supervision and control
of things in the hands of a few families.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The county
seat or
Court
House.</div>

<p>This county court usually met as often as once a
month in some convenient spot answering to the
shire town of England or New England. More
often than not, the place originally consisted of
the court-house and very little else, and was named
accordingly from the name of the county, as Hanover
Court House or Fairfax Court House; and
the small shire towns that have grown up in such
spots often retain these names to the present
day. Such names occur commonly
in Virginia, West Virginia, and South
Carolina, and occasionally elsewhere. Their number
has diminished from the tendency to omit the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
phrase “Court House,” leaving the name of the
county for that of the shire town, as for example
in Culpeper, Va. In New England the process of
naming has been just the reverse; as in Hartford
County, Conn., or Worcester County, Mass., which
have taken their names from the shire towns.
Here, as in so many cases, whole chapters of history
are wrapped up in geographical names.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a></p>

<div id="Powers_of_the_court" class="sidenote">Powers of
the court.</div>

<div id="The_sheriff" class="sidenote">The sheriff.</div>

<p>The county court in Virginia had jurisdiction in
criminal actions not involving peril of life or limb,
and in civil suits where the sum at stake exceeded
twenty-five shillings. Smaller suits could be tried
by a single justice. The court also had
charge of the probate and administration
of wills. The court appointed its own clerk, who
kept the county records. It superintended the
construction and repair of bridges and highways,
and for this purpose divided the county into “precincts,”
and appointed annually for each precinct
a highway surveyor. The court also seems to
have appointed constables, one for each precinct.
The justices could themselves act as coroners, but
annually two or more coroners for each parish
were appointed by the governor. As we have seen
that the parish taxes&mdash;so much for salaries of
minister and clerk, so much for care of church
buildings, so much for the relief of the poor, etc.&mdash;were
computed and assessed by the vestry; so
the county taxes, for care of court-house and jail,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
roads and bridges, coroner’s fees, and allowances
to the representatives sent to the colonial legislature,
were computed and assessed by the county
court. The general taxes for the colony were
estimated by a committee of the legislature, as well
as the county’s share of the colony tax. The
taxes for the county, and sometimes the taxes for
the parish also, were collected by the sheriff.
They were usually paid, not in money, but in
tobacco; and the sheriff was the custodian
of this tobacco, responsible for its
proper disposal. The sheriff was thus not only
the officer for executing the judgments of the
court, but he was also county treasurer and collector,
and thus exercised powers almost as great
as those of the sheriff in England in the twelfth
century. He also presided over elections for representatives
to the legislature. It is interesting to
observe how this very important officer was chosen.
“Each year the court presented the names of three
of its members to the governor, who appointed
one, generally the senior justice, to be the sheriff
of the county for the ensuing year.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Here again
we see this close corporation, the county court,
keeping the control of things within its own hands.</p>

<div id="The_county_lieutenant" class="sidenote">The county
lieutenant.</div>

<p>One other important county officer needs to be
mentioned. In early New England each town had
its train-band or company of militia, and the companies
in each county united to form the county
regiment. In Virginia it was just the other way.
Each county raised a certain number of troops,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
and because it was not convenient for the men to
go many miles from home in assembling for purposes
of drill, the county was subdivided into military
districts, each with its company, according to
rules laid down by the governor. The military
command in each county was vested in
the county lieutenant, an officer answering
in many respects to the lord lieutenant of the
English shire at that period. Usually he was a
member of the governor’s council, and as such
exercised sundry judicial functions. He bore the
honorary title of “colonel,” and was to some extent
regarded as the governor’s deputy; but in later
times his duties were confined entirely to military
matters.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a></p>

<p>If now we sum up the contrasts between local
government in Virginia and that in New England,
we observe:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. That in New England the management of
local affairs was mostly in the hands of town
officers, the county being superadded for certain
purposes, chiefly judicial; while in Virginia the
management was chiefly in the hands of county
officers, though certain functions, chiefly ecclesiastical,
were reserved to the parish.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span></p>

<p>2. That in New England the local magistrates
were almost always, with the exception of justices,
chosen by the people; while in Virginia, though
some of them were nominally appointed by the
governor, yet in practice they generally contrived
to appoint themselves,&mdash;in other words, the local
boards practically filled their own vacancies and
were self-perpetuating.</p>

<div id="Jeffersons_opinion_of_township_government" class="sidenote">Jefferson’s
opinion of
township
government.</div>

<p>These differences are striking and profound.
There can be no doubt that, as Thomas Jefferson
clearly saw, in the long run the interests of political
liberty are much safer under the New England
system than under the Virginia system.
Jefferson said: “Those wards, called
townships in New England, are the vital
principle of their governments, and have proved
themselves the wisest invention ever devised by
the wit of man for the perfect exercise of self-government,
and for its preservation.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> ... As Cato,
then, concluded every speech with the words <i>Carthago
delenda est</i>, so do I every opinion with the
injunction: ‘Divide the counties into wards!’”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p>

<div id="Court_day" class="sidenote">“Court day.”</div>

<p>We must, however, avoid the mistake of making
too much of this contrast. As already hinted, in
those rural societies where people generally knew
one another, its effects were not so far-reaching as
they would be in the more complicated society of
to-day. Even though Virginia had not the town
meeting, “it had its familiar court-day,”
which “was a holiday for all the countryside,
especially in the fall and spring. From all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
directions came in the people on horseback, in
wagons, and afoot. On the court-house green
assembled, in indiscriminate confusion, people of
all classes,&mdash;the hunter from the backwoods, the
owner of a few acres, the grand proprietor, and
the grinning, heedless negro. Old debts were settled,
and new ones made; there were auctions,
transfers of property, and, if election times were
near, stump-speaking.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a></p>

<div id="Virginia_prolific_in_great_leaders" class="sidenote">Virginia prolific
in great
leaders.</div>

<p id="Summary">For seventy years or more before the Declaration
of Independence the matters of general public
concern, about which stump speeches were
made on Virginia court-days, were very similar to
those that were discussed in Massachusetts town
meetings when representatives were to be chosen
for the legislature. Such questions generally related
to some real or alleged encroachment upon
popular liberties by the royal governor, who, being
appointed and sent from beyond sea, was apt to
have ideas and purposes of his own that conflicted
with those of the people. This perpetual antagonism
to the governor, who represented British
imperial interference with American local self-government,
was an excellent schooling in political
liberty, alike for Virginia and for Massachusetts.
When the stress of the Revolution came, these two
leading colonies cordially supported each other,
and their political characteristics were reflected in
the kind of achievements for which each was
especially distinguished. The Virginia system,
concentrating the administration of local affairs in
the hands of a few county families, was eminently
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
favourable for developing skilful and vigorous
leadership. And while in the history of
Massachusetts during the Revolution we
are chiefly impressed with the remarkable
degree in which the mass of the people
exhibited the kind of political training that nothing
in the world except the habit of parliamentary
discussion can impart; on the other hand,
Virginia at that time gave us&mdash;in Washington,
Jefferson, Henry, Mason, Madison, and Marshall,
to mention no others&mdash;such a group of leaders
as has seldom been equalled.

<div id="The_Navigation_Act_of_1651" class="sidenote">The Navigation
Act
of 1651.</div>

<p id="Crude_mediaeval_methods_of_robbery">The rapid development of maritime commerce
in the seventeenth century soon furnished a new
occasion for human folly and greed to assert themselves
in acts of legislation. Crude mediæval
methods of robbery began to give place to the
ingenious modern methods in which men’s pockets
are picked under the specious guise of public
policy. Your mediæval baron would allow no
ship or boat to pass his Rhenish castle without
paying what he saw fit to extort for the privilege,
and at the end of his evil career he was apt to
compound with conscience and buy a ticket to
heaven by building a chapel to the Virgin. Your
modern manufacturer obtains legislative aid in
fleecing his fellow-countrymen, while he seeks popularity
by bestowing upon the public a part of his
ill-gotten gains in the shape of a new college or
a town library. This change from the more brutal
to the more subtle devices for living upon the
fruits of other men’s labour was conspicuous during
the seventeenth century, and one of
the most glaring instances of it was the
Navigation Act of 1651, which forbade
the importation of goods into England except in
English ships, or ships of the nation that produced
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
the goods. This foolish act was intended to cripple
the Dutch carrying trade, and speedily led to
a lamentable and disgraceful war between England
and Holland. In its application to America it
meant that English colonies could trade only with
England in English ships, and it was generally
greeted with indignation. Cromwell, however, did
little or nothing to enforce it in America. Charles
II.’s government was more active in the matter
and soon became detested. One of the earliest
causes of the American Revolution was thus set
in operation. The policy begun in the Navigation
Act was one of the grievances that kept Massachusetts
in a chronic quarrel with Charles II. during
the whole of his reign, and it was a source of
no less irritation in Virginia.</p>

<div id="The_second_Navigation_Act" class="sidenote">The second
Navigation
Act.</div>

<p>A second Navigation Act, passed at the beginning
of the reign of Charles II., prescribed that
“no goods or commodities whatsoever shall be imported
into or exported from any of the
king’s lands, islands, plantations, or territories
in Asia, Africa, or America, in
any other than English, Irish, or plantation built
ships, and whereof the master and at least three-fourths
of the mariners shall be Englishmen, under
forfeiture of ships and goods.” It was further
provided that “no sugar, tobacco, cotton, wool, indigo,
ginger, fustic and other dyeing woods, of the
growth or manufacture of our Asian, African, or
American colonies, shall be shipped from the said
colonies to any place but to England, Ireland, or to
some other of his Majesty’s said plantations, there
to be landed, under forfeiture of goods and ships.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span></p>

<div id="Blands_remonstrance" class="sidenote">Bland’s remonstrance.</div>

<p>The motive in these restrictions is obvious
enough. Their effects were ably set forth in
1677, in a memorial by John Bland, a
sagacious London merchant, whose grasp
of the principles of political economy was very remarkable
for that age.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> In order that merchants
in England might buy Virginia tobacco very
cheap, the demand for it was restricted by cutting
off the export to foreign markets. In order that
they might sell their goods to Virginia at exorbitant
prices, the Virginians were prohibited from
buying anything elsewhere. The shameless rapacity
of these merchants was such as might have
been expected under such fostering circumstances.
If the planter shipped his own tobacco to England,
the charges for freight would be put so high as to
leave him scarcely any margin of profit.</p>

<div id="Some_direct_consequences" class="sidenote">Some direct
consequences.</div>

<p>Such restrictions were apt to have other effects
than those contemplated. The “protected” merchants
chuckled over their sagacity in keeping
Dutchmen away from Virginia, for thus it would
become possible to make the Dutchmen
pay three or four shillings in England
for tobacco that cost a ha’penny in the
colony. But the worthy burghers of the Netherlands
took a different view of the matter. They
began planting tobacco for themselves in the East
Indies, so that it became less necessary to buy it
of the English. Another somewhat curious consequence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
may be stated in Bland’s own words:
“Again, if the Hollanders must not trade to Virginia,
how shall the planters dispose of their
tobacco? The English will not buy it [all], for
what the Hollander carried thence was a sort of
tobacco not ... used by us in England, but
merely to transport for Holland. Will it not
then perish on the planters’ hands? which undoubtedly
is not only an apparent loss of so much
stock and commoditie to the plantations who suffer
thereby, but for want of its employment an infinite
prejudice to the commerce in general.”</p>

<div id="Some_indirect_consequences" class="sidenote">Some indirect
consequences.</div>

<p>There was yet another aspect of the matter. “I
demand then, in the next place, which way shall
the charge of the governments be maintained, if
the Hollanders be debarred trade in Virginia
and Maryland, or anything raised
to defray the constant and yearly levies
for the securing the inhabitants from invasions of
the Indians? How shall the forts and public
places be built and repaired, with many other
incident charges daily arising, which must be taken
care for, else all will come to destruction? for
when the Hollanders traded thither, they paid
upon every anchor of brandy (which is about 25
gallons) 5 shillings import brought in by them,
and upon every hogshead of tobacco carried thence
10 shillings; and since they were debarred trade,
our English, as they did not, whilst the Hollander
traded there, pay anything, neither would they
when they traded not ...; so that all these
charges being taxed on the poor planters, it hath
so impoverished them that they scarce can recover
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
wherewith to cover their nakedness. As foreign
trade makes rich and prosperous any country that
hath within it any staple commodities to invite
them thither, so it makes men industrious, striving
with others to gather together into societies, and
building of towns, and nothing doth it sooner than
the concourse of shipping, as we may see before
our eyes, Dover and Deal what they are grown
into, the one by the Flanders trade, the other by
ships riding in the Downs.”</p>

<div id="Exposure_of_the_humbug" class="sidenote">Exposure of
the humbug.</div>

<p>But if in spite of all these arguments the Navigation
Act must stand, then, says this
acute writer, “let me on the behalf of
the said colonies of Virginia and Maryland make
these following proposals, which I hope will
appear but equitable:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“<i>First</i>, that the traders to Virginia and Maryland
from England shall furnish and supply the
planters and inhabitants of those colonies with all
sorts of commodities and necessaries which they
may want or desire, at as cheap rates and prices
as the Hollanders used to have when the Hollander
was admitted to trade thither.</p>

<p>“<i>Secondly</i>, that the said traders out of England
to those colonies shall not only buy of the
planters such tobacco ... as is fit for England,
but take off all that shall be yearly made by them,
at as good rates and prices as the Hollanders used
to give for the same, by bills of exchange or
otherwise....</p>

<p>“<i>Thirdly</i>, that if any of the inhabitants or
planters of the said colonies shall desire to ship
his tobacco or goods for England, that the traders
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
from England to Virginia and Maryland shall let
them have freight in their ships at as low and
cheap rates as they used to have when the Hollanders
and other nations traded thither.</p>

<p>“<i>Fourthly</i>, that for maintenance of the governments,
raising of forces to withstand the invasions
of the Indians, building of forts and other public
works needful in such new discovered countries,
the traders from England to pay there in Virginia
and Maryland as much yearly as was received of
the Hollanders and strangers as did trade thither,
whereby the country may not have the whole burden
to lie on their hard and painful labour and
industry, which ought to be encouraged but not
discouraged.</p>

<p>“Thus having proposed in my judgment what
is both just and equal, to all such as would not
have the Hollanders permitted to trade into Virginia
and Maryland, I hope if they will not agree
hereunto, it will easily appear it is their own
profits and interest they seek, not those colonies’s
nor your Majesty’s service, but in contrary the
utter ruin of all the inhabitants and planters
there; and if they perish, that vast territory
must be left desolate, to the exceeding disadvantage
of this nation and your Majesty’s honour
and revenue.”</p>

<div id="Blands_own_proposal" class="sidenote">Bland’s own
proposal.</div>

<p>After this keen exposure of the protectionist
humbug the author concludes by offering his own
proposal. “Let all Hollanders and other nations
whatsoever freely trade into Virginia
and Maryland, and bring thither and
carry thence whatever they please,” with only one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
qualification. It had been urged that, without
legislative aid, English shipping could not compete
successfully with that of other countries. Insatiableness
of commercial greed begets a fidgetty,
unreasoning dread of anything like free competition.
Just as the Frenchman puts tariff duties
upon German goods because he knows he cannot
compete with Germans in a free market, while at
the same moment the German puts tariff duties
upon French goods because he knows he cannot
compete with Frenchmen in a free market, so it
was with men’s arguments two centuries ago. It
was urged that French and Dutch ships could be
built and navigated at smaller expense than English
ships; and this point our author meets by
suggesting a differential tonnage-duty “to counterpoise
the cheapness,” only great care must be
taken not to make it prohibitory.</p>

<div id="Distress_caused_by_low_price_of_tobacco" class="sidenote">Distress
caused by
low price
of tobacco.</div>

<p>The principal effect of the Navigation Act upon
Virginia and Maryland was to lower the price of
tobacco while it increased the cost of
all articles imported from England. As
tobacco was the circulating medium in
these colonies, the effect was practically a depreciation
of the currency with the usual disastrous
consequences. There was an inflation of
prices, and all commodities became harder to get.
Efforts were made from time to time to contract
the currency by curtailing the tobacco crop. It
was proposed, for example, in 1662, that no tobacco
should be planted in Maryland or Virginia
for the following year. Such proposals recurred
from time to time, but it proved impossible to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
secure concerted action between the two colonies.
In 1664 the whole tobacco crop of Virginia was
worth less than £3 15s. for each person in the
colony. In 1666 so much tobacco was left on the
hands of the planters that a determined effort was
made to enforce the cessation of planting, and
after much discussion an agreement was reached
between Maryland, Virginia, and the new settlements
in Carolina, but the plan was defeated by
disapproval in Maryland which led to a veto from
Lord Baltimore. In 1667 the price of tobacco
fell to a ha’penny a pound, and Thomas Ludwell,
writing to Lord Berkeley in London, “declared
that there were but three influences restraining
the smaller landowners of Virginia from rising
in rebellion, namely, faith in the mercy of God,
loyalty to the king, and affection for the government.”<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<div id="The_Surry_protest_1673" class="sidenote">The Surry
protest,
1673.</div>

<p>The discontent sometimes took the form of a
disposition to resist the collection of taxes, as in
Surry, in December, 1673, when “a company of
seditious and rude people to y<sup>e</sup> number of ffourteene
did unlawfully Assemble at y<sup>e</sup> pish church
of Lawnes Creeke, w<sup>th</sup> Intent to declare they would
not pay theire publiq taxes, &amp; y<sup>t</sup> they
Expected diverse oth<sup>rs</sup> to meete them,
who faileing they did not put theire
wicked design in Execution.” Nevertheless these
persons assembled again, some three weeks later, in
an old field “called y<sup>e</sup> Divell’s field,” where they
passed divers lawless resolutions interspersed with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
heated harangues. In particular one Roger Delke
did say, “we will burne all before one shall Suffer,”
and when brought before the magistrates, “y<sup>e</sup>
s<sup>d</sup> Delke Acknowledged he said y<sup>e</sup> same words, &amp;
being asked why they meet at y<sup>e</sup> church he said by
reason theire taxes were soe unjust, &amp; they would
not pay it.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a> The ringleaders in this affair were
fined, but Governor Berkeley remitted the fines,
provided “they acknowledged their faults and pay
the court charges.”</p>

<div id="The_Arlington_Culpeper_grant" class="sidenote">The Arlington-Culpeper
grant,
1673.</div>

<p>Another cause of trouble was the king’s recklessness
in rewarding public services or gratifying
favourites by extensive grants of wild land in
America. It was an easy way to pay debts, for it
cost the king nothing, and all the labour
and expense of making the grant valuable
fell upon the grantee. To many of
these grants there could, of course, be no objection.
Those that founded the Carolinas and Pennsylvania
and the Hudson Bay Company were all
proper enough. The trouble began when territory
already granted and occupied by Englishmen was
given away again. There were some complicated
and obscure instances of this in New England,
but a flagrant and exasperating case occurred in
Virginia in 1673, when Charles made a grant of
the whole country to the Earl of Arlington and
Lord Culpeper, to hold for thirty-one years at a
yearly rent of 40 shillings to be paid at Michaelmas.</p>

<div id="Some_of_its_effects" class="sidenote">Some of its
effects.</div>

<p>The practical effect of this grant was to convert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
Virginia into something like a proprietary government,
with Arlington and Culpeper for proprietors.
It was, of course, not the intention to disturb
individuals in the possession of lands already
acquired by a valid title; but escheated lands were
to go to these proprietors instead of the
crown, and there was an opportunity for
grievous injustice, for many escheated lands were
occupied by persons who had purchased them in
good faith. The lord proprietors were to receive
the revenues of the colony, to appoint all public
officers, and to present pastors for installation.
In short, the entire control of the internal administration
of the colony was to be placed in their
hands, and against such favourites of the king an
appeal at any time was likely to be of little avail.
It is needless to add that the grant was made without
consulting the Virginians. For people who
had lavished so much loyalty upon a worthless
sovereign, this was a scurvy requital. To find its
match for ingratitude one must go to the story of
Inkle and Yarico. No sooner did the House of
Burgesses hear of it than they sent commissioners
to England to make an energetic protest. They
found the king rather surprised to hear that the
Virginians cared anything about such a trifle; he
promised to satisfy everybody, and that naturally
took some time, so that the matter was still under
discussion when things came to a blaze in Virginia.</p>

<div id="Character_of_Sir_William_Berkeley" class="sidenote">Character of
Sir William
Berkeley.</div>

<p>The unprincipled government of Charles II. in
England was matched in some respects by the
oppressive administration of Sir William Berkeley
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
in Virginia. We have already met this gentleman
on several occasions; it is now time to notice
him more particularly. He was son of
Sir Maurice Berkeley, who was one of
the members of the London Company
when it was first organized in 1606. Several members
of the family were interested in American
affairs. Sir William’s elder brother, Lord Berkeley
of Stratton, was a favourite of Charles II.,
and one of the group of proprietors to whom that
king granted Carolina in 1663. Sir William was
an aristocrat to the ends of his fingers, a man of
velvet and gold lace, a brave soldier, a devoted
husband, a chivalrous friend, and withal as narrow
and bigoted and stubborn a creature as one could
find anywhere. He had no sympathy with common
people, nor any very clear sense of duty toward
them. When he first arrived in Virginia in
1642, at the age of thirty-four, he was considered
very gracious and affable in manners, and during
the ten years of his first governorship he seems to
have been generally popular. From 1652 to 1660
he lived in retirement on his rural estate of Greenspring
near Jamestown, where he had an orchard
of more than 2,000 fruit trees&mdash;apples, pears,
quinces, peaches, and apricots&mdash;and a stable of
seventy fine horses. There he entertained Cavalier
guests and drank healths to King Charles until he
was once more called to Jamestown to be governor.
In 1661 he went to London and stayed for a year,
and it was afterwards thought that his visit with
his froward and hot-tempered brother<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> worked a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
change in him for the worse. Berkeley’s errand
in London was to oppose an attempt which the
old London Company was making to have its
charter restored; the people of Virginia had long
ago passed the stage at which they regretted the
overthrow of the Company. During his stay in
London, Berkeley saw one of his own plays performed
at the theatre, for this courtier and Cavalier
dabbled in literature. Of this tragi-comedy,
“The Lost Lady,” Pepys tells us in his Diary
that at first he did not care much for it, but liked
it better the next time he saw it.<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a></p>

<div id="Berkeleys_violent_temper" class="sidenote">Berkeley’s

temper.</div>

<p>After Berkeley’s return to Virginia the evils
of Charles’s misgovernment soon began to show
themselves. A swarm of place-hunters beset the
king, who carelessly gave them appointments in
Virginia, or recommended them to Berkeley for
places. Judges and sheriffs, revenue collectors
and parsons, were thus appointed
without reference to fitness, with the
natural results; the law was ill-administered, the
public money embezzled, and the church scandalized.
The custom-house charges on exported
tobacco afforded chances for extortion and blackmailing,
of which abundant advantage was taken,
and Berkeley was not the sort of man who was
quick to punish the rogues of his own party.
Enemies accused him of profiting by the maladministration
of his officials, and he himself confessed
in a rather cynical letter to Lord Arlington
that, while advancing years had taken away his
ambition, they had left him covetous. A little
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
group of wealthy planters, friends of Berkeley,
obtained places on the council, and contrived to
have everything their own way for several years.
With their aid the governor tried to do away with
the popular election of representatives. Amid the
blaze of royalist exultation over the restoration of
monarchy, the House of Burgesses elected in 1661
contained a large majority of members
who believed in high prerogative and
divine right; and Berkeley, having thus
secured a legislature that was quite to his mind,
kept it alive for fifteen years, until 1676, simply by
the ingenious expedient of <i>adjourning</i> it from year
to year, and refusing to issue writs for a new election.
The effect of such things was to carry more
than one staunch Cavalier over into what was by no
means a Puritan but none the less a strong opposition
party. As this opposition could not find adequate
voice in the legislature, it became ready for
an explosion. As Berkeley’s old popularity ebbed
away he grew arrogant and cross, and now and
then some instance of mean vindictiveness swelled
the rising tide of hatred against him. He became
subject to fits of violent passion. The famous
Quaker preacher, William Edmundson, who visited
Virginia in 1672, called on the governor
and sought to intercede with him for the
Society of Friends, the members of which
were shamefully treated in that colony. “He was
very peevish and brittle,” says Edmundson, “and
I could fasten nothing on him, with all the soft
arguments I could use.... The next day was
the men’s meeting at William Wright’s house
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
[where I met] Major-General Bennett.... He
asked me ‘How I was treated by the governor?’
I told him ‘he was brittle and peevish.’... He
asked me ‘if the governor called me dog, rogue,
etc.’ I said ‘No.’ ‘Then,’ said he, ‘you took him
in his best humour, those being his usual terms
when he is angry, for he is an enemy to every
appearance of good.’”<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a></p>

<div id="Beginning_of_the_Indian_war" class="sidenote">Beginning of
the Indian
war, 1675.</div>

<p>Such was the governor of Virginia and such the
state of things there, when to the many troubles
that were goading the people to rebellion the horrors
of the tomahawk and scalping-knife were
suddenly added. In 1672, after a fearful struggle
of twenty years’ duration, the Five Nations of
New York had completely overthrown
and nearly annihilated their kinsmen the
Susquehannocks. The defeated barbarians,
slowly retreating southward, roamed on both
sides of the Potomac, while parties of the victors,
mostly from the Seneca tribe, pursued and harassed
them. Early in the summer of 1675 some
Algonquins of the Doeg tribe, dwelling in Stafford
County, not far from the site of Fredericksburg,
got into a dispute with one of the settlers
and stole some of his pigs. The thieves were
pursued, and in the chase one or two of them were
shot. A few days afterward a herdsman was
found mortally wounded at the door of his cabin,
and said with his dying breath that it was Doegs
who had done it. Then the county lieutenant
of Stafford turned out with his militia to punish
the offenders. This officer was Colonel George
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
Mason, whose cavalry troop had gone down before
Cromwell’s resistless blows in the crowning mercy
at Worcester. He was great-grandfather of the
George Mason who sat in the Federal Convention
of 1787. One party of Colonel Mason’s men
overtook and slew eleven of the Algonquins, and
another party at some distance in the forest had
already shot fourteen red men, when a chief came
running up to Colonel Mason and told him that
these latter were friendly Susquehannocks, and
that the murderers of the herdsman were neither
Algonquins nor Susquehannocks, but Senecas.
The firing was instantly stopped, but the unfortunate
affair had evil consequences. Murders by
Indians along the Potomac became frequent. The
Susquehannocks occupied an old blockhouse on
the Maryland side of the river, and a force of
Marylanders, commanded by Major Thomas Truman,
marched out to dislodge them.</p>

<div id="John_Washington" class="sidenote">John
Washington.</div>

<p>At the request of the Maryland government,
Virginia sent a party to coöperate in this task. Its
commander bore a name which his great-grandson
was to make forever illustrious.
Colonel John Washington had come over from
England in 1657, with his younger brother Lawrence,
and settled in Westmoreland County. He
was now forty-four years old, a man of wealth
and influence, a leading judge, and member of the
House of Burgesses.</p>

<div id="The_five_Susquehannock_envoys" class="sidenote">The five
Susquehannock
envoys.</div>

<p>When the Virginia troops crossed the Potomac
they found their Maryland allies assembled before
the blockhouse, with five Susquehannocks in custody.
These Indians were envoys who had come
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
out for a parley, but had apparently taken alarm
and sought to escape, whereupon Major Truman
seized and detained them until the Virginians
should arrive. Then Colonel
Washington, with his next in command,
Major Isaac Allerton, proceeded to interrogate
the Indians, while Major Truman listened in
silence. Washington demanded satisfaction for
the murders and other outrages committed in
Virginia, but the Indians denied everything and
declared that their deadly enemies the Senecas
were the sole offenders. Washington then asked
how it happened that several canoe-loads of beef
and pork, stolen from the plantations, had been
carried into the Susquehannock fort; was it their
foes the Senecas who were thus supplying them
with food? And how did it happen that a party
of Susquehannocks just captured in Virginia were
dressed in the clothes of Englishmen lately murdered?
The falsehood was too palpable. The
guilt of the Susquehannocks was plain, and they
must either make amends or taste the rigours of
war.</p>

<p>There can be little doubt that Colonel Washington
was right. Then, as always until after 1763,
the Long House was from end to end the steadfast
ally of the English, and nothing could be
more unlikely than that one of its tribes should
have been guilty of these murders. It is quite
clear that the Susquehannocks lied, with the
double purpose of saving themselves and bringing
down vengeance upon the Senecas. The first
murders had been committed by Algonquins, and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
evidently the Susquehannocks had joined in the
work in retaliation for the unfortunate mistake
committed by Colonel Mason’s men.</p>

<div id="The_killing_of_the_envoys" class="sidenote">The killing
of the
envoys.</div>

<p>At the close of the conference Major Truman
called to Colonel Washington, asking if these were
not impudent rogues to deny the murders they
had done, when at that very moment the corpses
of nine of their own tribe were lying unburied at
Hurston’s plantation, where in a fight the defenders
of the place had just slain them. As the
envoys persisted in denying that these dead Indians
were Susquehannocks, Washington suggested
that they should be taken to Hurston’s
and confronted with the bodies. So Truman’s
men marched away with the five
envoys, and presently put them to death, “w<sup>ch</sup>
was occation,” says one of the Virginian witnesses,
“y<sup>t</sup> much amaized &amp; startled us &amp; ou<sup>r</sup> Comanders,
being a thing y<sup>t</sup> was never imagined or expected.”<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a></p>

<p>The killing of these envoys was in violation of
a rule that holds in all warfare, whether savage or
civilized, and Truman was impeached for it in the
Maryland assembly; but owing to an obstinate
disagreement between the two houses as to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
penalty to be inflicted, he escaped without further
punishment than the loss of his seat in the council.</p>

<div id="Berkeleys_perverseness" class="sidenote">Berkeley’s
perverseness.</div>

<div id="Indian_atrocities" class="sidenote">Indian
atrocities.</div>

<p>Colonel Washington’s force proved too small
to hold in check the infuriated Susquehannocks,
who seem to have entered into alliance with the
Algonquins of the country. Soon the whole border,
from the Potomac to the falls of the James,
was swarming with painted barbarians, and day
after day renewed the tale of burning homes and
slaughtered wives and children. This sort of thing
went on through the fall and winter,
driving people into frenzy, but Berkeley
would not call out a military force for
the occasion. He insisted that it was enough to
instruct the county lieutenants, each in his county,
to keep his militia in readiness. It was charged
against him that fear of losing his share in a very
lucrative fur trade made him unwilling to engage
in war with the Indians. However this may have
been, the spirit of the people had become so mutinous
that he was probably afraid to entrust himself
to the protection of a popular militia. Whatever
the motive of his conduct, its consequences
were highly disastrous. On a single day
in January, 1676, within a circle of ten
miles’ radius, thirty-six people were murdered; and
when the governor was notified, he coolly answered
that “nothing could be done until the assembly’s
regular meeting in March”!<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> Meanwhile the
work of firebrand and tomahawk went on. In
Essex County (then known as Rappahannock),
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
sixty plantations were destroyed within seventeen
days. It was thought by some persons that the
Indians were stimulated by reports of the fearful
havoc which their brethren were making in New
England, where King Philip’s war was raging.
Surely the wrath of the planters must have been
redoubled when they heard of the stalwart troop led
by Josiah Winslow into the Narragansett country,
and noted the stern vengeance it wrought there
on a December day of 1675, and contrasted these
things with what they saw before them. As the
Charles City people afterward declared with bitterness,
“we do acknowledge we were so unadvised
then ... as to believe it our duty incumbent on
us both by the laws of God and nature, and our
duty to his sacred Majesty, notwithstanding ...
Sir William Berkeley’s prohibition, ... to take
up arms ... for the just defence of ourselves,
wives, and children, and this his Majesty’s country.”<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a>
At length, in March, the Long Assembly,
as people called it, which had been elected in
1661, was convened for the last time; a force of
500 men was gathered, and all things were in
readiness for a campaign, when Berkeley by proclamation
disbanded the little army, declaring that
the frontier forts, if duly prepared and equipped,
afforded all the protection the country needed. To
many people this seemed to be adding insult to
injury; for while no fortress could prevent the
skulking approach of the enemy through the tangled
wilderness, it was widely believed that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
repairing of forts was simply a device for enabling
the governor’s friends to embezzle the money
granted for the purpose.</p>

<p>At this time there was a young man of eight-and-twenty
living on his plantation on
James River, hard by Curl’s Wharf. His
name was Nathaniel Bacon, son of Thomas Bacon,
of Friston Hall, Suffolk, a kinsman of the great
Lord Bacon.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> His mother was daughter of a Suffolk
knight, Sir Robert Brooke. He had studied
law at Gray’s Inn, and after extensive travel on
the continent of Europe had come to Virginia
with his young wife shortly before the beginning
of these Indian troubles. His father’s cousin,
Nathaniel Bacon, of King’s Creek, who had dwelt
in the colony since about 1650, was a man of large
wealth and influence. The abilities and character
of the young Nathaniel were rated so high that he
already had a seat in the council. He was clearly
an impetuous youth, brave and cordial, fiery at
times, and gifted with a persuasive tongue. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
was in person tall and lithe, with swarthy complexion
and melancholy eyes, and a somewhat lofty
demeanour. One writer says that his discourse
was “pestilent and prevalent logical,” and that it
“tended to atheism,” which doubtless means that
he criticised things freely. Two other prominent
men were much of his way of thinking. One was
a hard-headed and canny Scotchman,
William Drummond, who had been governor
of the Albemarle colony in Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
The other was Richard Lawrence, an Oxford
graduate of scholarly tastes, whom an old chronicler
has labelled for posterity as “thoughtful Mr.
Lawrence.” Both Drummond and Lawrence were
wealthy men, and lived, it is said, in the two best
built and best furnished houses in Jamestown,
which, it should be remembered, had scarcely more
than a score of houses all told.</p>

<div id="He_defeats_the_Indians" class="sidenote">He defeats

<p>Beside the estate where Bacon lived, he had
another one farther up, on the site still marked
by the name “Bacon Quarter Branch” in the
suburbs of Richmond. “If the redskins meddle
with me,” quoth the fiery young man,
“damn my blood but I’ll harry them,
commission or no commission!” One
May morning in 1676 news came to Curl’s Wharf
that the Indians had attacked the upper estate,
and killed Bacon’s overseer and one of his servants.
A crowd of armed planters on horseback
assembled, and offered to march under Bacon’s
lead. He made an eloquent speech, accepted the
command, and sent a courier to the governor to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
ask for a commission. Berkeley returned an evasive
answer, whereupon Bacon sent him a polite
note, thanking him for the promised commission,
and forthwith started on his campaign. He had
not gone many miles when a proclamation from
the governor overtook him, commanding
the party to disperse. A few obeyed;
the rest kept on their way and inflicted a severe
defeat upon the Indians. Then Bacon and his
volunteers marched homeward.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a></p>

of Burgesses.</div>

<div id="Arrest_of_Bacon" class="sidenote">Arrest of Bacon.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the indignant Berkeley had gathered
a troop of horse and taken the field in person to
arrest this refractory young man. But suddenly
came the news that the whole York peninsula
was in revolt. The governor must needs hasten
back to Jamestown, where he soon realized that if
he would avoid civil war he must dissolve
his moss-grown House of Burgesses and
issue writs for a new election. This was
done. In anticipation of such an emergency, an
act had been passed in 1670 restricting the suffrage
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
by a property qualification, which had called
forth much indignation, since previously universal
suffrage had prevailed. In this excited election
of 1676 the restriction was openly disregarded
in many places, and unqualified persons voted
illegally. Bacon offered himself as a candidate
for Henrico County and was elected by a large
majority. As he drew near to Jamestown in his
sloop with thirty followers, a war-ship lay at anchor
awaiting him, and the high sheriff
arrested him with his whole party. He
was taken into the brick State House and confronted
with the governor, who simply said, “Mr.
Bacon, have you forgot to be a gentleman?” “No,
may it please your honour,” said Bacon. “Very
well,” said Berkeley, “then I’ll take your parole.”
This was discreet in the governor, since the election
had gone so heavily against him. Bacon was
released and went to lodge in the house of Richard
Lawrence.</p>

<div id="Thoughtful_Mr_Lawrence" class="sidenote">“Thoughtful”
Mr.
Lawrence.</div>

<p>This “thoughtful” gentleman, the Oxford
scholar, “for wit, learning, and sobriety equalled
by few,” is said to have “kept an ordinary,”
while his house was one of the best in Jamestown.
It should be remembered that the permanent residents
in the town numbered less than a hundred,<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a>
while the sessions of the assembly brought a great
influx of temporary sojourners, so that
any or every house would be made to
serve as a tavern. Some years before,
Mr. Lawrence had been “partially treated at law,
for a considerable estate on behalf of a corrupt
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
favourite” of Sir William Berkeley; a fact well
certified by the testimony of the governor’s friend,
Colonel Lee. For this reason Lawrence bore the
governor a grudge and spoke of him as a treacherous
old villain. It was believed by some people
that in the conduct of the rebellion Lawrence was
the Mephistopheles and Bacon simply the Faust
whom he prompted.</p>

<div id="Bacons_submission" class="sidenote">Bacon’s submission.</div>

<p>There seems to have been an understanding
that, if Bacon were to acknowledge his offence in
marching without a commission, he should be received
back to his seat in the council, and the
governor would give him a commission
to go and finish the Indian war. The
old Nathaniel Bacon, of King’s Creek, being “a
very rich politic man and childless,” and intending
to leave his estates to young Nathaniel, succeeded
in persuading him, “not without much
pains,” to accept the compromise. The old gentleman
wrote out a formal recantation, which his
young kinsman consented to read in public, and
a scene was made of it. The State House was
a two-story building in which the burgesses had
lately begun sitting apart on the second floor,
while the governor and council (in point of dignity
the “upper house”) held their session on
the first floor. On the 5th of June, 1676, the
burgesses were summoned to attend in the council
chamber while Berkeley opened parliament. In
his opening speech the governor referred to the
Indian troubles, and expressed himself with strong
emphasis on the slaying of the five envoys: “If
they had killed my grandfather and grandmother,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
my father and mother and all my friends, yet if
they had come to treat of peace they ought to have
gone in peace!”<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Then, changing the subject,
the governor announced: “If there be joy in the
presence of the angels over one sinner that repenteth,
there is joy now, for we have a penitent
sinner come before us. Call Mr. Bacon.” The
young man knelt at the bar of the assembly and
read aloud the prepared paper in which he confessed
that he had acted illegally, and offered
sureties for future good behaviour. Then said the
governor impressively, and thrice repeating the
words, “God forgive you! I forgive you.” “And
all that were with him,” interposed a member of
the council. “Yea,” continued Berkeley, “and
all those that were with you.” The sheriff at
once released Bacon’s followers, and he took his
old seat in the council, while the burgesses filed
off upstairs. Our informant, the member for
Stafford, tells us that while he was on his way up
to the burgesses that afternoon, and through the
open door of the council chamber descried “Mr.
Bacon on his quondam seat,” it seemed “a marvellous
indulgence” to one who had so lately been
proscribed as a rebel.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span></p>

<div id="In_spite_of_the_governors_unwillingness" class="sidenote">Governor
<i>vs.</i>
Burgesses.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Reform of
abuses.</div>

<p>The governor’s chief dread was the free discussion
of affairs in general by a hostile assembly.
Now that the Indian imbroglio had brought these
new burgesses together, he wanted them to confine
their talk to Indian affairs and then go home, but
this was not their way of thinking. They aimed,
though feebly, at greater independence
than heretofore, and the governor’s intent
was to frustrate this aim. It was moved
by one of his partisans in the House of Burgesses
“to entreat the governor would please to assign
two of his council to sit with and assist us in our
debates, as had been usual.” At this the friends
of Bacon scowled, and the member for Stafford
ventured to suggest that such aid might not be
necessary, whereat there was an uproar. The
Berkeleyans urged that “it had been customary
and ought not to be omitted,” but a shrewd old
assemblyman named Presley replied, “’Tis true it
has been customary, but if we have any bad customs
amongst us, we are come here to mend ’em.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a>
This happy retort was greeted with laughter, but
the Cavalier feeling of loyalty to the king’s representative
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
was still strong, and Berkeley’s friends
had their way, apparently in a tumultuous fashion.
As the member for Stafford says, the affair “was
huddled off without coming to a vote,” so that the
burgesses must “submit to be overawed and have
every carped at expression carried straight to the
governor.” Nevertheless, they went sturdily on to
their work of reform, and the acts which
they passed most clearly reveal the nature
of the evils from which the people had been suffering.
They restored universal suffrage; they
enacted that vestrymen should be elected by
popular vote, and limited their term of office to
three years; they reduced the sheriff’s term to a
single year; they declared that no person should
hold at one and the same time any two of the
offices of sheriff, surveyor, escheator, and clerk of
court; and they imposed penalties upon the delay
of public business and the taking of excessive fees.
Councillors with their families, and the families of
clergymen, had been exempted from taxation; this
odious privilege was now abolished. Sundry trade
monopolies were overthrown; two magistrates,
Edward Hill and John Stith, were disfranchised
for alleged misconduct; and provision was made
for a general inspection of public expenses and the
proper auditing of accounts.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a></p>

<div id="How_the_Queen_of_Pamunkey" class="sidenote">An Indian
“princess.”</div>

<p>The Indian troubles were not neglected. Arrangements
were made for raising and maintaining
an army of 1,000 men, and the aid of friendly
Indians was solicited. There was a picturesque
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
scene when the “Queen of Pamunkey” was
brought before the House of Burgesses. That interesting
squaw sachem appears to have been a
descendant of the fierce Opekankano. Her tribe
was the same that John Smith had visited on the
winter day when he held his pistol to the old warrior’s
head, with the terse mandate, “Corn or your
life!” That remnant of the Powhatan confederacy
was still flourishing in Bacon’s time, and
indeed it has survived to the present day, a mongrel
compound of Indian and negro, on two small
reservations in King William County.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a>
The “Queen of Pamunkey” in Bacon’s
time commanded about 150 warriors, and what the
assembly wanted was to secure their aid in suppressing
the hostile Indians. The dusky princess
“entered the chamber with a comportment graceful
to admiration, bringing on her right hand an
Englishman interpreter, and on the left her son, a
stripling twenty years of age, she having round
her head a plat of black and white wampum peag
three inches broad in imitation of a crown, and
was clothed in a mantle of dressed deerskins with
the hair outwards and the edge cut round six
inches deep, which made strings resembling twisted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
fringe from the shoulders to the feet; thus with
grave courtlike gestures and a majestic air in her
face she walked up our long room to the lower
end of the table, where after a few entreaties she
sat down; the interpreter and her son standing by
her on either side as they had walked up. Our
chairman asked her what men she would lend
us for guides in the wilderness and to assist us
against our enemy Indians. She spake to the interpreter
to inform her what the chairman said
(though we believed she understood him). He
told us she bid him ask [her] son to whom the English
tongue was familiar (and who was reputed the
son of an English colonel), yet neither would he
speak to or seem to understand the chairman, but,
the interpreter told us, he referred all to his mother,
who being again urged, she, after a little musing,
with an earnest passionate countenance as if tears
were ready to gush out, and a fervent sort of expression,
made a harangue about a quarter of an
hour, often interlacing (with a high shrill voice
and vehement passion) these words, <i>Totapotamoy
chepiack!</i> i. e. <i>Totapotamoy dead!</i> Colonel Hill,
being next me, shook his head. I asked him what
was the matter. He told me all she said was too
true, to our shame, and that his father was general
in that battle where divers years before<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a> Totapotamoy
her husband had led a hundred of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
Indians in help to the English against our former
enemy Indians, and was there slain with most of his
men; for which no compensation at all had been
to that day rendered to her, wherewith she now
upbraided us.”</p>

<div id="The_chairmans_rudeness" class="sidenote">The
chairman’s
rudeness.</div>

<p>The candid member for Stafford calls the chairman
of the committee morose and rude
for not so much as “advancing one cold
word towards assuaging the anger and
grief” of the squaw sachem. Having once obtained
a favour and so ill requited it, the white
men in an emergency were now suppliants for
further good offices of the same sort. But disregarding
all this, the chairman imperiously demanded
to be informed how many Indians she
would now contribute. A look of angry disdain
passed over the cinnamon face; she turned her
head away and “sat mute till that same question
being pressed a third time, she, not returning her
face to the board, answered with a low slighting
voice in our own language, <i>Six!</i> but, being further
importuned, she, sitting a little while sullen,
without uttering a word between, said, <i>Twelve!</i>
... and so rose up and walked gravely away, as
not pleased with her treatment.”</p>

<div id="Bacons_flight" class="sidenote">Bacon’s

<div id="His_speedy_return" class="sidenote">His return.</div>

<p>Small wisdom was shown in this mean and discourteous
treatment of a useful ally, but men’s
thoughts were at once abruptly turned from such
matters. “One morning early a bruit ran about
the town, Bacon is fled! Bacon is fled!”
and for the moment Indian alliances and
legislative reforms were alike forgotten. Mr.
Lawrence’s house was searched at daybreak, but
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
his lodger had gone. Not only had the governor
withheld the expected commission, but the air
was heavy with suspicion of treachery. The elder
Bacon, of King’s Creek, who was fond of “this
uneasy cousin” without approving his conduct,
secretly informed him that his life was in danger at
Jamestown. So the young man slipped away to his
estate at Curl’s, and within a few days marched
back upon Jamestown at the head of 600 men.
Berkeley’s utmost efforts could scarcely muster
100 men, of whom we are told that not half could
be relied on. Early in the warm June afternoon
Bacon halted his troops upon the green before the
State House, and walked up toward the
building with a little guard of fusileers.
The upper windows were filled with peering burgesses,
and crowds of expectant people stood about
the green. Out from the door came the old white-haired
governor, trembling with fury, and plucking
open the rich lace upon his bosom, shouted to
Bacon, “Here I am! Shoot me! ’Fore God, a
fair mark, a fair mark&mdash;shoot!” Bacon answered
mildly, “No, may it please your honour, we have
not come to hurt a hair of your head or of any
man’s. We are come for a commission to save our
lives from the Indians, which you have so often
promised, and now we will have it before we go.”</p>

<div id="How_the_governor_was_intimidated" class="sidenote">The governor
intimidated,

1676.</div>

<p>But we are told that after the old man had gone
in to talk with his council, Bacon fell into a rage
and swore that he would kill them all if the commission
were not granted. The fusileers presented
their pieces at the windows and yelled, “We will
have it! we will have it!” till shortly one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
burgesses shook “a pacifick handkercher” and
called down, “you shall have it.” All
was soon quiet again. The assembly drew
up a memorial to the king, setting forth
the grievances of the colony and Bacon’s valuable
services; and it made out a commission for him as
general of an army to be sent against the Indians.
Next day the governor was browbeaten into signing
both these papers; but the same ship that
carried the memorial to Charles II. carried also a
private letter wherein Berkeley told his own story
in his own way. The assembly was then dissolved.</p>

<div id="Bacons_march_to_Middle_Plantation" class="sidenote">Bacon’s

<p>Bacon was a commander who could move
swiftly and strike hard. Within four
weeks the remnant of the Susquehannocks
had been pretty nearly wiped out
of existence, when he heard that the governor had
proclaimed him and his followers rebels. It was
like a cry of despair from the old man,
who felt his power and dignity gone
while this young Cromwell rode over
him rough-shod. He tried to raise the
people in Gloucester, reputed the most loyal of the
counties, but his efforts were vain. Ominous
groans and calls of “a Bacon! a Bacon!” greeted
him, until in anticipation of still worse difficulties
he fled across Chesapeake Bay to the Accomac
peninsula, launching the proclamation behind him
like a Parthian arrow. This was on July 29, and
Richard Lawrence carried the news up-stream to
Bacon, who was probably somewhere about the
North Anna River. The young leader was stung
by what he felt to be cruel injustice. “It vexed
 <span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
him to the heart for to think that while he was
hunting Indian wolves, tigers, and foxes, which
daily destroyed our harmless sheep and lambs,
that he and those with him should be pursued
with a full cry, as a more savage or a no less
ravenous beast.” He quickly marched
back at the head of his troops to Middle
Plantation, half way between Jamestown
and York River, the site where Williamsburg was
afterward built. What had best be done was
matter of discussion between Bacon and his
friends, and the affair began to assume a more
questionable and dangerous aspect than before.
The Scotch adviser, William Drummond, was a
gentleman who did not believe in half measures.
When some friend warned him of the danger of
rebellion he was heard to reply, “I am in over
shoes; I will be over boots!” His wife was
equally bold. It was suggested one day that King
Charles might by and by have something to say
about these proceedings, whereupon Sarah Drummond
picked up a stick and broke it in two, exclaiming,
“I care no more for the power of England
than for this broken straw!” Bacon was
advised by Drummond to have Berkeley deposed
and the more placable Sir Henry Chicheley put
in his place; and as a precedent he cited the
thrusting out of Sir John Harvey, forty-one years
before. But Bacon preferred a different course of
action. First, he issued a manifesto in rejoinder
to Berkeley’s proclamation. A few ringing sentences
from it will serve as a sample of his peculiar
eloquence.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span></p>

<div id="His_manifesto" class="sidenote">His manifesto.</div>

<p>“If virtue be a sin, if piety be guilt, all the
principles of morality, goodness and justice be
perverted, we must confess that those who are
now called Rebels may be in danger of
those high imputations. Those loud and
several bulls would affright innocents, and render
the defence of our brethren and the inquiry into
our sad and heavy oppressions Treason. But if

to plead the cause of the oppressed, if sincerely to

we cannot in our hearts find one single spot of
rebellion or treason, or that we have in any manner
aimed at subverting the settled government or
attempting of the person of any either magistrate
or private man, notwithstanding the several reproaches
and threats of some who for sinister ends
were disaffected to us and censured our innocent
and honest designs, and since all people in all
places where we have yet been can attest our civil,
quiet, peaceable behaviour, far different from that
of rebellion [rebellious?] and tumultuous persons,
let Truth be bold and all the world know the real
foundations of pretended guilt. We appeal to
the country itself, what and of what nature their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
oppressions have been, or by what cabal and mystery
the designs of many of those whom we call
great men have been transacted and carried on.

<div id="His_arraignment_of_Berkeley" class="sidenote">His arraignment

Berkeley.</div>

<p>This is the prose of the seventeenth century,
which had not learned how to smite the reader’s
mind with the short incisive sentences to which
we are at the present day accustomed; but there
is no mistaking the writer’s passionate earnestness,
his straightforward honesty and dauntless
courage. As we read, we seem to see
the gleam of lightning in those melancholy
eyes, and we quite understand how
the impetuous youth was a born leader of men.
With strong words tumbling from a full heart the
manifesto goes on to “trace these men in authority,”
these “juggling parasites whose tottering
fortunes have been repaired at the public charge.”
He points out at some length the character of
the public grievances, and appeals to the king
with a formal indictment of Sir William Berkeley:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>“For having upon specious pretences of public
works raised unjust taxes upon the commonalty
for the advancement of private favourites and
other sinister ends, but no visible effects in any
measure adequate.</p>

<p>“For not having, during the long time of his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
government, in any measure advanced this hopeful
colony either by fortification, towns, or trade.</p>

<p>“For having abused and rendered contemptible
the majesty of justice, of advancing to places of
judicature scandalous and ignorant favourites.</p>

<p>“For having wronged his Majesty’s prerogative
and interest by assuming the monopoly of the
beaver trade.</p>

<p>“[For] having in that unjust gain bartered and
sold his Majesty’s country and the lives of his
loyal subjects to the barbarous heathen.</p>

<p>“For having protected, favoured, and emboldened
the Indians against his Majesty’s most loyal
subjects, never contriving, requiring or appointing
any due or proper means of satisfaction for their
many invasions, murders, and robberies committed
upon us.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">“Wicked
counsellors.”</div>

<p>And so on through several further counts. At
the close of the indictment nineteen persons are
mentioned by name as the governor’s “wicked and
pernicious counsellors, aiders and assisters
against the commonalty in these our
cruel commotions.” Among these names
we read those of Sir Henry Chicheley, Richard
Lee, Robert Beverley, Nicholas Spencer, and the
son of our old friend William Claiborne, who had
once been such a thorn in the side of Maryland.
The manifesto ends by demanding that Berkeley
and all the persons on this list be promptly
arrested and confined at Middle Plantation until
further orders. Let no man dare aid or harbour
any one of them, under penalty of being declared
a traitor and losing his estates.

<p>When he had launched this manifesto Bacon
called for a meeting of notables at Middle Plantation,
to concert measures for making it effective.
There on August 3, accordingly, were assembled
“most of the prime gentlemen of those parts,”
including four members of the council. The discussion
lasted all day, and was kept up by the
light of torches until midnight. There were many
who were not willing to go all lengths
with Bacon. All were willing to subscribe
an agreement not to aid Berkeley
in molesting Bacon and his men, but all were not
prepared to promise military aid to Bacon in
resisting Berkeley. Bacon insisted upon this and
even more. It was not unlikely that the king,
influenced by calumnies and misrepresentations,
might send troops to Virginia to suppress the so-called
“rebellion.” In that case all must unite in
opposing the royal forces until his Majesty should
be brought to see these matters in their true light.
Many demurred at this. It was equivalent to
armed rebellion. They would sign the first part
of the agreement, but not this. Bacon replied
that the governor had already proclaimed them
rebels, and would hang them for signing any part
of the agreement; one might as well be hanged for
a sheep as for a lamb, and as for himself he was
not going to be satisfied with half support. They
must choose between Berkeley and himself. It is
said that they might have argued all that summer
night but for a sudden Indian scare which emphasized
the need for prompt action. Then the hesitating
gentlemen came forward and signed the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
entire paper, while the whole company, and no
one more emphatically than Bacon himself, asseverated
that these proceedings in no way impaired
their allegiance. In other words, they were ready
if need be to make war on the king for his own
good. It was “We, the inhabitants of Virginia,”
that drew up this remarkable agreement, which
Charles II. was presently to read. Writs were
then made out in the king’s name for a new election
of burgesses and signed by the four councilmen.
Then Bacon crossed the James
River and defeated the Appomattox Indians
near the spot where Petersburg now stands.
After this he moved about the country, capturing
and dispersing the barbarians, until early in September
it might be said that every homestead in
the colony was safe.</p>

<div id="Startling_conversation_between_Bacon_and_Goode" class="sidenote">Startling
conversation
between
Bacon and
Goode.</div>

<p>In the proceedings which attended the taking of
the oath at Middle Plantation it may be plainly
seen that Bacon was in danger of alienating his
followers by pursuing too radical a policy. This
is strikingly confirmed by a document which has
only lately attracted attention, a letter
from John Goode to Sir William Berkeley,
dated January 30, 1677. This John
Goode was a veteran frontiersman of
sixty years, a man of importance in the colony.
He seems to have been a faithful adherent of
Bacon from his first march against the Indians in
May until the beginning of September, when there
occurred the conversation which, after all was
over, he reported to the governor as follows. The
affair is so important and so little known that I

and punctuation:<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a><span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

Bacon, deceased, propos’d to me on or about the 2d day
of September last, both in order and words as followeth:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Bacon.</span>&mdash;There is a report Sir Wm. Berkeley hath
sent to the king for 2,000 Red Coates, and I doe believe
it may be true, tell me your opinion, may not 500 Virginians
beat them, wee having the same advantages
against them the Indians have against us.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Goode.</span>&mdash;I rather conceive 500 Red Coats may either
Subject or ruine Virginia.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;You talk strangely, are not wee acquainted with
the Country, can lay Ambussadoes, and take Trees and
putt them by, the use of their discipline, and are doubtlesse
as good or better shott than they.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;But they can accomplish what I have sayd
without hazard or coming into such disadvantages, by
taking Opportunities of landing where there shall bee
noe opposition, firing out [our?] houses and Fences,
destroying our Stocks and preventing all Trade and
supplyes to the Country.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;There may bee such prevention that they shall
not bee able to make any great Progresse in Mischeifes,
and the Country or Clime not agreeing with their Constitutions,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
great mortality will happen amongst them,
in their Seasoning which will weare and weary them
out.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;You see Sir that in a manner all the principall
Men in the Countrey dislike your manner of proceedings,
they, you may bee sure will joine with the Red
Coates.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;But there shall none of them bee [permitted?].</p>

<p>G.&mdash;Sir, you speake as though you design’d a totall
defection from Majestie, and our native Country.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;Why (smiling) have not many Princes lost their
Dominions soe.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;They have been such people as have been able
to subsist without their Prince. The poverty of Virginia
is such, that the Major part of the Inhabitants
can scarce supply their wants from hand to mouth, and
many there are besides can hardly shift, without Supply
one yeare, and you may bee sure that this people
which soe fondly follow you, when they come to feele
the miserable wants of food and rayment, will bee in
greater heate to leave you, then [than] they were to come
after you, besides here are many people in Virginia that
receive considerable benefitts, comforts, and advantages
by Parents, Friends and Correspondents in England,
and many which expect patrimonyes and Inheritances
which they will by no meanes decline.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;For supply I know nothing: the Country will
be able to provide it selfe withall, in a little time, save
Amunition and Iron, and I believe the King of France
or States of Holland would either of them entertaine a
Trade with us.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;Sir, our King is a great Prince, and his Amity
is infinitely more valuable to them, then [than] any
advantage they can reape by Virginia, they will not
therefore provoke his displeasure by supporting his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Rebells here; besides I conceive that your followers do
not think themselves ingaged against the King’s Authority,
but against the Indians.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;But I think otherwise, and am confident of it,
that it is the mind of this country, and of Mary Land,
and Carolina also, to cast off their Governor and the
Governors of Carolina have taken no notice of the People,
nor the People of them, a long time;<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> and the
people are resolv’d to own their Governour further;
And if wee cannot prevaile by Armes to make our Conditions

own Governour, we may retire to Roanoke.</p>

<p>And here hee fell into a discourse of seating a Plantation
in a great Island in the River, as a fitt place to
retire to for Refuge.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;Sir, the prosecuting what you have discoursed
will unavoidably produce utter ruine and destruction to
the people and Countrey, &amp; I dread the thoughts of
putting my hand to the promoting a designe of such miserable
consequence, therefore hope you will not expect
from me.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;I am glad I know your mind, but this proceeds
from meer Cowardlynesse.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;And I desire you should know my mind, for
I desire to harbour noe such thoughts, which I should
fear to impart to any man.</p>

<p>B.&mdash;Then what should a Gentleman engaged as I
am, doe, you doe as good as tell me, I must fly or hang
for it.</p>

<p>G.&mdash;I conceive a seasonable Submission to the

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
such Errors and Excesse, as are yett past, there
may bee hope of remission.</p>

<p>I perceived his cogitations were much on this discourse,
hee nominated, Carolina, for the watch word.</p>

<p>Three days after I asked his leave to goe home, hee
sullenly Answered, you may goe, and since that time, I
thank God, I never saw or heard from him.</p>

<div id="Perilous_situation_of_Bacon" class="sidenote">Bacon’s
perilous
situation.</div>

<p>This interesting dialogue reveals the nature of
the situation into which Bacon had drifted. As
the days went by, he could hardly fail
to see that the king was more likely to
take Berkeley’s view of the case than his.
According to that view the deliverer of Virginia
from the Indians was a proscribed rebel who must
“fly or hang for it.” There was little hope for
Bacon in “seasonable submission.” He would,
therefore, consider it safer and better for Virginia
to hold out until the king could be induced to
take Bacon’s view of the case; or failing this, it
might still be possible to wear out the king’s troops
and achieve independence for Virginia, with the
aid of the discontented people in the neighbouring
colonies. These were the speculations of a man
whom circumstances were making desperate, and
the effect which they wrought upon John Goode
was likely to be repeated with many who had
hitherto loyally followed his fortunes.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Berkeley
takes the
offensive.</div>

<p>Thus far Bacon’s fighting had been against
Indians. His quarrel with the governor had been
confined to fulminations. Now the two men were
to come into armed collision and give Virginia a
brief taste of civil war. Bacon sent Giles Bland,
“a gentleman of an active and stirring disposition,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
with four armed vessels, to arrest Berkeley
in Accomac, but Colonel Philip Ludwell,
aided by treachery, succeeded in capturing
Bland with his flotilla. Bland was
put in irons, and one ship’s captain was
hanged for an example. Meanwhile Berkeley was
enlisting troops by promising as rewards the
estates of all the gentlemen who had taken the
oath at Middle Plantation. He also sought to win
over the indentured servants of gentlemen fighting
under Bacon by promising to give them the estates
of their masters. Many longshoremen also were
enrolled. Having in these ways scraped together
about 1,000 men, the governor sailed up the river
to Jamestown and took possession of the place,
from which Lawrence and Drummond fled in the
nick of time.</p>

<div id="The_White_Aprons_at_Jamestown" class="sidenote">The white
aprons.</div>

<p>When this news reached Bacon it found him at
West Point, with the work of subduing the red
men practically finished. Not four months had
yet elapsed since the first attack on his plantation.
It was clearly no ordinary young man that had
done that summer’s arduous work. Now he advanced
upon Jamestown, and made his headquarters
in his adversary’s comfortable mansion at
Green Spring. Sir William had thrown an earthwork
across the neck of the promontory, and
Bacon began building a parallel. It is
said that he compelled a number of ladies
in white aprons&mdash;wives of leading Berkeleyans&mdash;to
stand upon the works, and sent a message to
the governor not to fire upon these guardian angels.
“The poor gentlewomen were mightily astonished,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
says the chronicle, “and neither were their
bands void of amazement at this subtle invention.”<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a>
The incident is an ugly spot in that brief
career. One would gladly disbelieve the story, but
our contemporary authority for it seems unimpeachable,
and is friendly withal to Bacon.</p>

<div id="Bacons_speech_at_Green_Spring" class="sidenote">Bacon’s
speech.</div>

<p>The speech made by the young commander to
his men at Green Spring before the final assault
is a good specimen of his eloquence:
“Gentlemen and Fellow Soldiers, how I
am transported with gladness to find you thus
unanimous, bold and daring, brave and gallant.
You have the victory before the fight, the conquest
before the battle.... Your hardiness will
invite all the country along as we march to come
in and second you.... The ignoring of their
actions cannot but so much reflect upon their
spirit, as they will have no courage left to fight
you. I know you have the prayers and well
wishes of all the people in Virginia, while the
others are loaded with their curses. Come on,
my hearts of gold; he that dies in the field lies
in the bed of honour!”<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a></p>

Jamestown.</div>

<div id="Persons_who_suffered_at_Bacons_hands" class="sidenote">Sufferers at
Bacon’s
hands.</div>

<p>The governor’s motley force was indeed no
match for these determined men. In the desultory
fighting that ensued about Jamestown he was
badly defeated and at last fled again to Accomac.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Jamestown remained at Bacon’s mercy, and he
burned it to the ground, that it might no
longer “harbour the rogues.” We are
told that Lawrence and Drummond took the lead
in this work by applying the torch to their own
houses with their own hands. At Green Spring
an “oath of fidelity” was drawn up, which was
taken voluntarily by many people and forced upon
others. Bacon seems now to have shown more
severity than formerly in sending men to prison
and seizing their property. One deserter he shot,
but from bloodthirstiness he was notably free.
Among the gentlemen who suffered most at his
hands were Richard Lee and Sir Henry
Chichely, who were kept several weeks
in prison, Philip and Thomas Ludwell,
Nicholas Spencer and Daniel Parke, Robert Beverley
and Philip Lightfoot, whose estates were at
various times plundered. John Washington and
others who were denounced as “delinquents” saw
their corn and tobacco, cattle and horses, impressed
and carried away. Colonel Augustine
Warner, another great-grandfather of George
Washington, “was plundered as much as any,
and yet speaks little of his losses, though they
were very great.”<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Among the sufferers appears
“the good Queen of Pamunkey,” who was “driven,
out into the wild woods and there almost famished,
plundered of all she had, her people taken prisoners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
and sold; the queen was also robbed of her
rich watchcoat for which she had great value, and
offered to redeem at any rate.” The next paragraph
in the commissioners’ report is delightful:
“We could not but present her case to his Majesty,
who, though he may not at present so well
or readily provide remedies or rewards for the
other worthy sufferers, yet since a present of small
price may highly oblige and gratify this poor
Indian Queen, we humbly supplicate his Majesty
to bestow it on her.”</p>

<div id="Bacon_and_his_cousin" class="sidenote">Bacon and
his cousin.</div>

<p>One of the accusations against Bacon was that
to him a good Indian meant a dead Indian, so
that he did not take the trouble to discriminate
between friends and foes. But what shall we say
when we find him plundering his own kinsman,
the affectionate cousin whose timely warning
had once perhaps saved his life?
The commissioners report the losses of Nathaniel
Bacon the elder, at the hands of his “unnatural
kinsman,” as at least £1,000 sterling. The old
gentleman was “said to have been a person soe
desirous and Industrious to divert the evil consequences
of his Rebell kinsman’s proceedings, that
at the beginning hee freely proposed and promised
to invest him in a considerable part of his Estate
in present, and to leave him the Remainder in
Reversion after his and his wife’s death, offering
him other advantages upon condicion hee would
lay downe his Armes, and become a good subject to
his Majestie, that that colony might not be disturbed
or destroyed, nor his owne ffamily stained
with soe foule a Blott.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<div id="Death_of_Bacon" class="sidenote">Death of
Bacon, Oct.
1, 1676.</div>

<p>At the burning of Jamestown the end of Bacon
and of his rebellion was not far off. “This Prosperous
Rebell, concluding now the day his owne,
marcheth with his army into Gloster County,
intending to visit all the northern part of Virginia
... and to settle affairs after his own
measures.... But before he could arrive to the
Perfection of his designes (w<sup>ch</sup> none but the eye of
omniscience could Penetrate) Providence
did that which noe other hand durst (or
at least did) doe and cut him off.” Malarious
Jamestown wreaked its own vengeance
upon its destroyer. When Bacon marched away
from it he was already ill with fever, and on the
first day of October, at the house of a friend in
Gloucester, he “surrendered up that fort he was
no longer able to keep, into the hands of the grim
and all-conquering Captain, Death.” Accusations
of poison were raised, but it is not likely that any
other poison was concerned than impure water
and marsh gases. The funeral was conducted
with extraordinary secrecy. If a sudden turn of
fortune should put Berkeley in possession of the
body, he would surely hang it on a gibbet; so
thoughtful Mr. Lawrence took measures to prevent
any such indignity. One chronicler darkly
hints that Bacon’s remains were buried in some
very secret place in the woods, but another mentions
stones laid in the coffin, which suggests that
it was sunk beneath the waves of York River, as
Soto was buried in the Mississippi and mighty
Alaric in the Busento.</p>

<div id="Berkeleys_outrageous_conduct" class="sidenote">Outrageous
conduct of
Berkeley.</div>

<p>A strange meteoric career was that of young
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
Bacon, begun and ended as it was in the space of
about twenty weeks. On the news of his
death the rebellion collapsed with surprising
suddenness. His followers soon
began giving in their submissions to the governor;
the few that held out were dispersed or captured.
Although it was not until January that the work
of suppression was regarded as complete, yet that
work consisted chiefly in catching fugitives. In
January an English fleet arrived, with a
regiment of troops, and a commission
for investigating the affairs of Virginia.
The commissioners were Sir John Berry,
Sir Herbert Jeffries, and Colonel Francis Morison,
three worthy and fair-minded gentlemen. They
found nothing left for soldiers to do. They had
authority for trying rebels, but in that business
Berkeley had been beforehand. Soon after Bacon’s
death one of his best officers, Colonel Thomas
Hansford, was captured by Robert Beverley, and
carried over to Accomac. He asked no favour
save that he might be “shot like a soldier and not
hanged like a dog,” but this was not granted.
Hansford has been called “the first native martyr
to American liberty.”<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a> Soon afterward two captains
were hanged, and the affair of Major Edward
Cheesman seems to have occurred while Berkeley
was still at Accomac. It is the foulest incident
recorded in Berkeley’s career. When Cheesman
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
was brought before him, the governor fiercely
demanded, “Why did you engage in Bacon’s designs?”
Before the prisoner could answer, his
young wife stepped forward and said,
“It was my provocations that made my
husband join the cause; but for me he
had never done what he has done.” Then falling
on her knees before the governor, she implored
him that she might be hanged as the guilty one
instead of her husband.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> The old wretch’s answer
was an insult so atrocious that the royalist chronicler
can hardly abide it. “His Honour” must
have been beside himself with anger and could
not have meant what he said; for no woman could
have “so small an affection for her husband as to
dishonour him by her dishonesty, and yet retain
such a degree of love, that rather than he should
be hanged she will be content to submit her own
life to the sentence.” Perhaps the governor’s
thirst for vengeance was satisfied by his ruffian
speech, for Major Cheesman was not put to death,
but remanded to jail, where he died of illness.</p>

<div id="Execution_of_Drummond" class="sidenote">Execution of
Drummond.</div>

<p>After Berkeley had occupied the York peninsula
little work remained for him but that of the
hangman. Not all the leaders were easy to find.
Richard Lawrence, thoughtful as always, escaped
from the scene. “The last account of him,” says
T. M., “was from an uppermost plantation, whence
he and four other desperadoes, with horses, pistols,
etc., marched away in a snow ankle-deep.”
Here the scholarly rebel vanishes from our sight,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
and whether he perished in the wilderness or made
his way to some safer country, we do not know.
On a cold day in January his friend Drummond,
hiding in White Oak Swamp was found and taken
to the governor. “Aha!” cried the old man, with
a low bow, “you are very welcome. I would
rather see you just now than any other man in
Virginia. Mr. Drummond, you shall be
hanged in half an hour!” “What your
honour pleases,” said the undaunted Scotchman.
He was strung up that afternoon, but not until
his wife’s ring had been pulled from his finger,
for rapacity vied with ferocity in the governor’s
breast. Before the end of January some twenty
more had been hanged. An election was then
going on, and the newly-elected assembly called
upon Berkeley to desist from this carnival of
blood. “If we had let him alone,” said Presley,
the venerable member for Northampton, to T. M.,
the member for Stafford, “he would have hanged
half the country!”</p>

<div id="Death_of_Berkeley" class="sidenote">Death of Berkeley.</div>

<p>The governor’s rage had carried him too far.
His conduct did not meet with the approval of the
commissioners, whose report on the disturbances is
written in a fair and impartial spirit. He treated
the commissioners with crazy rudeness. It is said
that when they had called on him at Green Spring
and were about to return to their boat on the
river, he offered them his state-coach with the
hangman for driver! whereupon they preferred to
walk to the landing-place. Fresh seeds of contention
were sown, to bear fruit in the future.
The complaints of Drummond’s widow and others
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
found their way to the throne. “As I live,”
quoth the king, “the old fool has put to death
more people in that naked country than I did
here for the murder of my father.” In the spring
the royal order for Berkeley’s removal arrived,
and on April 27 he sailed for England, apparently
expecting to return, for he left his wife at Green
Spring. Sir Herbert Jeffries, one of the commissioners,
succeeded him with a special commission
as lieutenant governor. Berkeley’s departure was
joyfully celebrated with bonfires and salutes of
cannon. He cherished hopes of justifying himself
in a personal interview with the king, but the
interview was delayed until, about the
middle of July, the old man fell sick and
died. It was believed that his death was caused
by vexation and chagrin. A few weeks afterward
the other two commissioners, Sir John Berry and
Colonel Morison, returned to England; and we
are told that one day the late governor’s brother,
Lord Berkeley, meeting Sir John Berry in the
council chamber, told him “with an angry voice
and a Berkeleyan look,” that he and Morison had
murdered his brother.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> In October a royal order
for the relief of Sarah Drummond declared that
her husband “had been sentenced and put to
death contrary to the laws of the kingdom.”</p>

<div id="Significance_of_the_rebellion" class="sidenote">Significance of the rebellion.</div>

<p>Thus ended the first serious and ominous tragedy
in the history of the United States, a story preserved
for us in many of its details with striking
vividness, yet concerning the innermost significance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
of which we would fain know more than
we do. It may fairly be pronounced the most
interesting episode in our early history, surpassing
in this regard the Leisler affair at New York,
which alone can be compared with it for
intensity of human interest. As ordinarily
told, however, the story of Bacon
presents some features that are unintelligible. It
is customary to liken the little rebellion of 1676
to the great rebellion of 1776, and we are thus
led to contemplate Bacon and Virginia as arrayed
against Berkeley and England. In such a view
the facts are unduly simplified and strangely distorted.
If it were possible thus fully to identify
Bacon’s cause with the cause of Virginia, it would
become impossible to explain the ease with which
his followers were suppressed by Virginians, without
any aid from England. But when all the
facts are considered, we can see at once that such
a result was inevitable.</p>

<p>Careful inspection of the relevant facts will
show us that Bacon was contending against four
things:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. The Indian depredations.</p>

<p>2. The misrule of Sir William Berkeley.</p>

<p>3. The English navigation laws.</p>

<p>4. The tendency toward oligarchical government
which had been rapidly growing since the
beginning of the great influx of Cavaliers in
1649.</p>

<div id="How_far_Bacon_represented_popular_sentiment" class="sidenote">How far Bacon represented public sentiment in Virginia.</div>

<p>Under the first three heads little need be said.
The facts have been generally recognized. It was
by Bacon’s zeal and success in suppressing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
Indian power that he acquired public favour. As
for the peculation and extortion practised
or permitted by Berkeley, it cannot
for a moment be supposed that such men
as John Washington, Richard Lee, etc.,
were inclined to tolerate or connive at it. As for
the navigation laws, it was a common remark,
after the oath at Middle Plantation, that now
Virginians might look forward hopefully to trading
with all countries. It is therefore altogether
probable that on all these grounds the public sentiment
of Virginia was overwhelmingly on the side
of Bacon.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The leading families were in general opposed to him.</div>

<p>Under the fourth head some explanation is
needed, for historians have generally overlooked
or disregarded it. One of the most conspicuous
facts in the story of Bacon’s rebellion is the fact
that a great majority of the wealthiest and most
important men in the colony were opposed
to him from first to last. The
list of those who were pillaged by his
followers is largely a list of the names
most honoured in Virginia, the great-grandfathers
of the illustrious men who were among the foremost
in winning independence for the United
States and in building up our federal government.
It is also largely a list of the names of Cavaliers
who had come from England to Virginia since
1649. The political ideas of these men were
surely not democratic. If they were devout disbelievers
in popular government, the fact is in
nowise to their discredit. Popular government is
still on its trial in the world, and the last word on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
the subject has not yet been said. In our day the
men who do the most to throw discredit upon it
are often those who prate most loudly in its
favour; political blatherskites, like the famous
“Colonel Yell of Yellville,” whose accounts were
sadly delinquent though his heart beat with fervour
for his native land. The Cavaliers who came
to Virginia were staunch and honourable men who
believed&mdash;with John Winthrop and Edmund
Burke and Alexander Hamilton&mdash;that society is
most prosperous when a select portion of the
community governs the whole. Such a doctrine
seems to me less defensible than the democratic
views of Samuel Adams and Thomas Jefferson
and Herbert Spencer, but it is still entitled to all
the courtesies of debate. Two centuries ago it
was of course the prevailing doctrine.</p>

<div id="Restriction_of_the_suffrage" class="sidenote">Restriction of the suffrage.</div>

<p>In the preceding chapter I pointed out that the
period of Cavalier immigration, between 1650 and
1670, was characterized by a rapid increase in the
dimensions of landed estates and in the employment
of servile labour. The same period
witnessed a change of an eminently symptomatic
kind in local government. In
any state the local institutions are the
most vitally important part of the whole political
structure. Now, as I have already mentioned,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a>
the English parish was at an early time reproduced
in Virginia, and its authority was exercised
by a few chosen men, usually twelve, who constituted
a vestry. At first, and until after 1645,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> the
vestrymen were elected by the people of the parish,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>
so that they were analogous to the selectmen of
New England. A vestry thus elected is called an
open vestry. Now soon after the Long Assembly
had begun its sessions in 1661, in the fall tide of
royalist reaction, we find on its records a statute
which transformed the open vestry into a close
vestry. In March, 1662, it was enacted that “in
case of the death of any vestryman, or his departure
out of the parish, ... the minister and vestry
make choice of another to supply his room.”<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> The
speedy effect of this was to dispense with the popular
election and to convert the vestry into a self-perpetuating
close corporation. When we consider
the great powers wielded by the vestry, we realize
the importance of this step. The vestry made
up the parish budget, apportioned the taxes, and
elected the churchwardens, who were in many
places the tax-collectors. By its “processioning of
the bounds of every person’s land,” the vestry
exercised control over the record of land-titles. Its
supervision of the counting of tobacco was also a
function of no mean importance. The vestry also
presented the minister for induction. All the local
government not in the hands of the vestry was
administered by the county court, which consisted
of eight justices appointed by the governor. So
that when the people lost the power of electing vestrymen
they parted with the only share they had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
in the local government.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> Nothing was left them
except the right to vote for burgesses,
and not only was this curtailed in 1670 by
a property qualification, but it was of no
avail while the Long Assembly lasted, since during
those fifteen years there were no elections. That
political power should thus rapidly become concentrated
in the hands of the leading families was
under the circumstances but natural. That the
deprivation of suffrage was by many people felt to
be a grievance is unquestionable.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> No testimony
can outweigh that of the statute book, and two of
the notable acts of Bacon’s assembly in June,
1676, were those which restored universal suffrage
and the popular election of vestrymen, and limited
the terms of service of vestrymen to three years.
The first assembly after the rebellion, which met
at Green Spring in February, 1677, with Augustine
Warner as speaker, declared all the acts of
Bacon’s assembly null and void. Then in the
course of that year and the three years following
several of those wholesome acts were reënacted,
especially those which related to exorbitant fees
and the misuse of public money. Great pains
were taken to guard against extortion and corruption,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a>
but the provisions concerning vestrymen
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
were not reënacted. A law was passed allowing
the freeholders and housekeepers in each parish to
elect six “sober and discreet” representatives to
sit with the vestry and have equal votes with the
vestrymen in assessing the parish taxes; in case
the parish should neglect to choose such representatives,
or in case they should fail to appear at
the time appointed, the vestry was to proceed without
them.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> This act seems to have had little
effect, and the law of 1662, which created the close
vestry, still remained law after more than a century
had passed.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a> As for the right to vote for
burgesses, the royal instructions received from
Charles II. in January, 1677, restricted it to
“ffreeholders, as being more agreeable to the
custome of England, to which you are as nigh as
you conveniently can to conforme yourselves.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>
According to the same instructions the assembly
was to be called together only once in two years,
“unlesse some emergent occasion shall make it
necessary;” and it was to sit “ffourteene days
... and noe longer, unlesse you find goode cause
to continue it beyond that tyme;” qualifications
which could easily be made to defeat the restriction.</p>

<div id="How_the_aristocrats_regarded_Bacons_followers" class="sidenote">How the aristocrats regarded Bacon’s followers.</div>

<p>The legislation of Bacon’s assembly concerning
the suffrage and the vestries proves that the people
whom he represented were not in sympathy with
the political and social changes which had been
growing up since the middle of the century. These
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
enactments were a protest against the increasing
tendency toward a more aristocratic type of society.
It was, therefore, natural that a large
majority of the aristocrats should have been opposed
to Bacon. Doubtless they sympathized
with his protests against legislative
oppression and official corruption,
but they did not approve of his levelling
schemes. Their language concerning Bacon’s followers
shows how they felt about them and toward
them. William Sherwood calls them “y<sup>e</sup> scum of
the Country.”<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a> According to Philip Ludwell,
deputy secretary and member of the council,
Bacon “gathers about him a Rabble of the basest
sort of People, whose Condicion was such, as by
a chaunge could not admitt of worse, w<sup>th</sup> these he
begins to stand at Defyance ag’t the Governm’t.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a>
Again, “Mr. Bacon had Gotten at severall places
about 500 men, whose fortune and Inclinations
being equally desperate, were ffit for y<sup>e</sup> purpose
there being not 20 in y<sup>e</sup> whole Route, but what
were Idle &amp; will not worke, or such whose Debaucherie
or Ill Husbandry has brought in Debt

<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>

none themselves, would have all magistracie &amp;

together) Mr. Bacon marches speedly toward the
towne, etc.”<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> Governor Berkeley’s testimony
should not be omitted; he wrote to the king in
June, “I have above thirty-five years governed
the most flourishing country the sun ever shone
over, but am now encompassed with rebellion like
waters in every respect like to that of Masaniello
except their leader.”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> In other words, the rebels
were a mere rabble, except their leader, who was
not a humble fisherman like the Italian, but a
gentleman of high birth and breeding. According
to the careful and fair-minded commissioners,
Bacon “seduced the Vulgar and most ignorant
People (two-thirds of each county being of that
Sort) Soe that theire whole hearts and hopes were
set now upon” him.<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>

<div id="The_real_state_of_the_case" class="sidenote">The real state of the case.</div>

<p>Allowance for prejudice must of course be made
in considering the general statements of hostile
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
witnesses, such as Berkeley and Sherwood and
Philip Ludwell. It is quite clear that Bacon’s
followers were by no means all of the
baser sort. This is distinctly recognized
in a letter to the king by Thomas Ludwell
and Robert Smith, containing proposals for
reducing the rebels. In a certain event, they say,
“there will be a speedy separation of the sound
parts from the rabble.”<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> Here we have an explicit
admission that there was a “sound part.”
It will be remembered that Drummond had been
a colonial governor, and that his house and Lawrence’s
were the best in Jamestown. The officers
we have met in the story, Hansford and Bland
and Cheesman, were men of good family; and
among the foremost men in the colony we are told
that Colonel George Mason was inclined to sympathize
with the insurgents.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a> In this he was clearly
by no means alone. On the whole, however, there
can be no doubt that Bacon’s cause was to a considerable
extent the cause of the poor against the
rich, of the humble folk against the grandees.</p>

<div id="Effect_of_hard_times" class="sidenote">Effect of hard times.</div>

<div id="Populist_aspect_of_the_rebellion" class="sidenote">Populist aspects of the rebellion.</div>

<div id="Its_sound_aspects" class="sidenote">Its sound aspects.</div>

<p>When we take into account this aspect of the
case, which has never received the attention it
deserves, the whole story becomes consistent and
intelligible. The years preceding the rebellion
were such as are commonly called “hard times.”
People felt poor and saw fortunes made
by corrupt officials; the fault was with
the Navigation Act and with the debauched civil
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
service of Charles II. and Berkeley. Besides these
troubles, which were common to all, the poorer
people felt oppressed by taxation in regard to
which they were not consulted and for which they
seemed to get no service in return.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> The distribution
of taxation by polls, equal amounts for rich
and for poor, was resented as a cruel injustice.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a>
The subject of taxation was closely connected with
the Indian troubles, for people paid large sums for
military defence and nevertheless saw their houses
burned and their families massacred. Under these
circumstances the sudden appearance of the brave
and eloquent Bacon seemed to open the way of
salvation. The indomitable queller of Indians
could also curb the tyrant. Naturally, along with
a more respectable element, the rabble gathered
under his standard; it is always the case in revolutions
with the men who have little or nothing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
to lose. It is likewise usual for men with much
property at stake to be conservative on
such occasions. Philip Ludwell’s statement,
that some of the rebels entertained
communistic notions, is just what one might have
expected. There is always more or less socialist
tomfoolery at such times. In some of its aspects
there is a resemblance between Bacon’s rebellion
and that of Daniel Shays in Massachusetts one
hundred and ten years later. But the Massachusetts
leader was a weak and silly creature, and his
resistance to government had nothing to justify
it, though there were palliating circumstances.
The course of Bacon, on the other hand, was in
the main a justifiable protest against misgovernment,
and until after the oath at Middle
Plantation a great deal of the sound
sentiment in Virginia must have sympathized with
him. In the unwillingness of some of the gentlemen
present to take the oath, we seem to see the
first ebbing of the tide. Evidently there began
to be, as Thomas Ludwell had predicted, “a separation
of the sound parts from the rabble;” and
this appears very distinctly in the defection of
Goode about four weeks later.</p>

<p>In the intention of resisting the king’s troops,
which thus weakened Bacon’s position, he certainly
showed more zeal than judgment. It has
the look of the courage that comes from desperation.
Had he lived to persist in this course, the
policy most likely to strengthen him would have
been to make his foremost demand the repeal of
the Navigation Act which all Virginians detested
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
and even Berkeley disapproved. But it is not
likely that anything could have saved him from
defeat and the scaffold. Death seems to have
intervened in kindness to him and to Virginia.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a></p>

<p>In the early history of our country Bacon must
ever remain one of the bright and attractive figures.
Our heart is always with the man who
boldly stands out against corruption and oppression.
To many persons the name of rebel seems
fraught with blame and reproach; but the career
of mankind so abounds in examples of heroic
resistance to intolerable wrongs that to any one
familiar with history the name of rebel is often a
title of honour. Bacon’s brief career was an episode
in the perennial fight against taxation without
representation, the ancient abuse of living on other
men’s labour. We cannot fail to admire his quick
incisiveness, his cool head, his determined courage;
and the spectacle of this young Cavalier taking
the lead, like Tiberius Gracchus, in a movement
for justice and liberty will always make a pleasing
picture.

<div id="A_century_of_political_education" class="sidenote">Political education.</div>

<p>Between the breaking out of Bacon’s rebellion
in the summer of 1676 and the Declaration
of Independence, the interval was exactly a hundred
years. It was for Virginia a century of
political education. It prepared her for the great
work to come, and it brought her into
sympathy more or less effective with
other colonies that were struggling with similar
political questions, especially with Massachusetts.
It was in that same year, 1676, that Charles II.
sent Edward Randolph to Boston, to enforce the
Navigation Act and to report upon New England
affairs in general. This mission of Randolph led
to quarrels which resulted in the overthrow of the
charter and the sending of royal governors to
Massachusetts. From that time forth the legislatures
of Massachusetts and Virginia had to contend
with similar questions concerning the powers
and prerogatives of the royal governors, so that
the two colonies kept a close watch upon each
other’s proceedings, while both received a thorough
training in constitutional politics. Amid such
circumstances came into existence the necessary
conditions for the establishment of political independence
and the formation of our Federal Union.

<div id="Robert_Beverley_1" class="sidenote">Robert Beverley.</div>

<div id="His_refusal_to_give_up_the_journals" class="sidenote">His refusal to give up the journals.</div>

<p>The suppression of Bacon’s rebellion was far
from equivalent to a surrender to Charles II. or
his representatives. Questions of privilege soon
arose, and it was not long before Berkeley’s most
efficient officer came himself to be regarded almost
in the light of a rebel. Major Robert
Beverley, of Beverley in Yorkshire, an
ardent royalist, had come to Virginia in 1663.
He was elected clerk of the House of Burgesses
in 1670, and held that office for many years. No
one was more active in stamping out rebellion in
the autumn of 1677, but after the arrival of the
royal commissioners he was soon at feud with
them. As the disturbances had been quieted without
the aid of their troops, there was a disposition
to resent their coming as an interference, especially
as they seemed to lend too ready an ear to
the complaints of the malcontents. In the list of
grievances of Gloucester County we find “a complaint
against Major Robert Beverley that when
the country had (according to Order) raised 60
armed men to be an Out-guard for the Governor&mdash;who
not finding the Governor nor their
appointed Comander they were by Beverly comanded
to goe to work, fall trees and maule and
toate railes, which many of them refusing to doe,
he presently disbanded them &amp; sent them home at
a tyme when the countrey were infested by the
Indians, who had a little before cut off six persons
in one family, and attempted others.” Upon this
the commissioners remarked, “Wee conceive this
dealing of Beverly’s to be a notorious abuse and
Grievance, to take away the peoples armes while
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
ther famlies were cutt off by the Indians, and
they deserve just reparation here.” But Berkeley
declared that what Beverley had done was by his
orders, and the newly elected House of Burgesses
stood by its clerk. After Berkeley had sailed for
England, in April, 1677, the commissioners called
upon the House of Burgesses to give up
its journals for their inspection, and Beverley
refused to comply with the demand.
No king in England, said the burgesses, would
venture to make such a demand of the House of
Commons. Then the commissioners seized the
journals, and the burgesses indignantly voted that
such an act was a violation of privilege. This
enraged the king, and in February, 1679, the
privy council ordered that Beverley should be
removed from office.</p>

<div id="Lord_Culpeper" class="sidenote">Lord Culpeper.</div>

<p>A change of governors, however, altered the situation.
After Jeffries and Chichely, who served
but a year each, came Lord Culpeper, whom
Charles II. had undertaken to make co-proprietor
of Virginia, along with the Earl of Arlington.
Culpeper was an average specimen of
the public officials of the time, fairly
agreeable and easy-going, but rapacious and utterly
unprincipled. In one respect he might be
contrasted unfavourably with all the governors
since Harvey. Such men as Bennett and Mathews
and Berkeley looked upon Virginia as home.
After his own fashion the tyrannical Berkeley had
the interest of Virginia at heart. But Culpeper
regarded the Virginians simply as people to be
fleeced. Through four years of chronic brawl he
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
kept coming and going, coming to manage the
assembly and returning to consult with the king.
Charles wished to have the power of initiating
legislation taken away from the burgesses. All
laws were to be drafted by the governor and council,
and then sent to England for the royal approval,
before being submitted to the burgesses.
With such an arduous task before him, it was
wise for Culpeper to avoid giving needless offence;
and seeing the high regard in which Beverley was
held, he caused the order for his removal to be
revoked.</p>

<div id="The_plant_cutters_riot_of_1682" class="sidenote">The Plant-cutter’s Riot, 1682.</div>

<p>The evil effects of the Navigation Act still continued.
In 1679 the tobacco crop was so large
that a considerable surplus was left over till the
next year unsold. In 1680 the surplus was still
greater, so that there was evidently more than
enough to supply the English market for two
years. The assembly therefore proposed to order
a cessation of planting for the year 1681,
but on account of the customs revenue it
was necessary to obtain the king’s assent
to such an order. By the same token the assent
was refused, and great was the indignation in Virginia.
The price of tobacco had fallen so low
that, according to Nicholas Spencer, a whole
year’s crop would not so much as buy the clothes
which people needed.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> The distress was like that
which was caused in the War of Independence by
the Continental currency and the rag money issued
by the several states. It was the kind of sickness
that has always come and always will come with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
“cheap money.” Culpeper insisted that the only
chance of relief was in exporting beef, pork, and
grain to the West Indies. A more effective measure
would have been the repeal of the Navigation
Act. In the spring of 1682, on the petition of
several counties, the assembly was convened for
the purpose of ordering a cessation of planting.
Amid great popular excitement the assembly adjourned
without taking any decisive action. Then
a fury for destroying the young plants seized upon
the people. “The growing tobacco of one plantation
was no sooner destroyed than the owner,
having been deprived either with or without his
consent of his crop, was seized with the same
frenzy and ran with the crowd as it marched to
destroy the crop of his neighbour.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> The contagion
spread until ten thousand hogsheads of tobacco
had been destroyed. In Gloucester, where
the most damage was done, two hundred plantations
were laid waste. The riot was suppressed by
the militia, three ringleaders were hung, and the
rest pardoned. One, we are told, received pardon
on condition that he should build a bridge.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a></p>

<div id="Culpepers_removal" class="sidenote">Culpeper’s removal.</div>

<p id="Contracting_the_currency_with_a_vengeance">This was contracting the currency with a vengeance,
but it produced the desired effect. In
1683 the purchasing power of tobacco was greatly
increased, and a feeling of contentment returned.
But the destruction of the plants served to heighten
the king’s indignation at Culpeper’s ill success
in curtailing the power of the burgesses. Culpeper
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
tried to play a double part and appear complaisant
to the assembly without offending the
king. Consequently he pleased nobody, and early
in 1684 he was removed. Shortly afterward
the king confirmed him in the possession
of the territory known as the Northern
Neck, and he relinquished all proprietary claims
upon the rest of Virginia, in exchange for a pension
of £600 yearly for twenty years.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Lord Howard of Effingham.</div>

<p>Culpeper’s successor was Lord Howard of
Effingham, an unworthy descendant of
Elizabeth’s gallant admiral. He was as
greedy and dishonest as Culpeper, without
his conciliatory temper. The difference between
the two has been aptly compared to the
difference between Charles II. and his brother.
Howard was indeed as domineering and wrong-headed
as James II., and rapacious besides. He
treated public opinion with contempt. His administration
was noted for corruption and tyranny.
No accounts were rendered of the use of public
funds, and men were arbitrarily sent to jail.
Howard went so far as to claim the right to repeal
the acts of the assembly, and over this point there
was hot contention. The subject of “plant-cutting,”
or the destruction of growing tobacco, came
up again, and the crown was enabled in one and
the same act to wreak its vengeance upon an
eminent victim and to aim a blow at the independence
of the House of Burgesses.</p>

<div id="More_trouble_for_Beverley" class="sidenote">More trouble for Beverley.</div>

<p>Robert Beverley, as we have seen, had incurred
the royal displeasure by refusing to hand over
to the commissioners the journals of the House of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
Burgesses. In 1682 he was strongly in favour
of a cessation of planting, and accordingly
it suited the purposes of his enemies
to point to him as the prime instigator
of the plant-cutting riots. On this accusation he
was turned out of office and several times imprisoned.
At last, just after Lord Howard’s arrival,
he was set free after asking pardon on his bended
knees and giving security for future good behaviour.
A statute passed about this time made
plant-cutting high treason, punishable with death
and confiscation.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<p>As soon as Beverley was set free the House of
Burgesses again chose him for its clerk. But
presently Lord Howard tried to get the burgesses
to allow him to levy a tax, and in the course of
the quarrel sundry trumped-up charges were
brought against Beverley, so that in 1686 James
II. instructed Howard to declare him incapable of
holding any office of public trust. The same
letter ordered that henceforth the clerk of the
House of Burgesses should be appointed by the
governor.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a></p>

<div id="For_stupid_audacity_James_II" class="sidenote">For stupid audacity James II. was outdone by George III.</div>

<p>It is worthy of note that the most despicable
and lawless of modern English kings
did not venture to deny the right of Virginians
to tax themselves by their own
representatives. Howard’s instructions
merely authorized him to “recommend” certain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
measures to the assembly. His attempt to get
permission to levy a tax independently of the burgesses
was such a recommendation. However
arrogant and illegal in spirit, it still conceded to
the colonists the constitutional principle over
which the fatuous George III. and his rotten-borough
parliaments were to try to ride rough-shod.</p>

<div id="Francis_Nicholson_comes_to_govern_Virginia" class="sidenote">Francis
Nicholson.</div>

<p>By 1688 Howard concluded that it would be
pleasant and comfortable for him to live on his
governor’s salary in England and send out a
deputy-governor to deal with refractory burgesses.
When he arrived in England he found William
and Mary on the throne, but they showed no disposition
to interfere with his plans. Just the right
sort of man for deputy-governor appeared at the
right moment. Francis Nicholson had
held that position in New York under
the viceroy of united New York and New England,
Sir Edmund Andros. When that unpopular

<div class="sidenote">His
manners.</div>

<p>Nicholson was a man of integrity and fair
ability, though highly eccentric and cantankerous.
“Laws of Virginia,” he cried one day, seizing the
attorney-general by the lapel of his silk robe, “I
know no laws of Virginia! I know my
commands are going to be obeyed here!”
At another time he told the council that they
were “mere brutes who understood not manners,
... that he would beat them into better manners
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
and make them feel that he was governor of
Virginia.”<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a></p>

<div id="How_James_Blair_founded_William_and_Mary_College" class="sidenote">James Blair,
founder of
William
and Mary
College.</div>

<p>In spite of his queer peppery ways, the rule of
Nicholson was a decided relief after such worthless
creatures as Culpeper and Howard. It is
chiefly memorable for the founding of the second
American college, a work which encountered such
obstacles on both sides of the ocean as only an
iron will could vanquish. Such was found in the
person of James Blair, a Scotch clergyman,
who in 1689 was appointed commissioner
of the Church in Virginia. The
need for a bishop was felt, and a little
later there was some talk of sending out the
famous Jonathan Swift in that capacity, but no
Episcopal bishopric was created in America until
after the War of Independence. Dr. Blair had a
seat in the colonial council, presided at ecclesiastical
trials, and exercised many of the powers of a
bishop. Since the old scheme of Nicholas Ferrar
and his friends for a college in Virginia had been
extinguished amid lurid scenes of Indian massacre,
nearly seventy years had elapsed<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> when Blair in
1691 revived it. He began by collecting some
£2,500 by subscription, and then went to England
to get more money and obtain a charter. He
was aided by two famous divines, Tillotson, Archbishop
of Canterbury, and Stillingfleet, Bishop of
Worcester, but from the treasury commissioner,
Sir Edward Seymour, he received a coarse rebuff,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
which shows the frankly materialistic view at that
time entertained by the British official mind regarding
England’s colonies. When Blair urged
that a college was needed for training up clergymen,
Seymour thought it was no time to be sending
money to America for such purposes; every
penny was wanted in Europe for carrying on the
necessary and righteous war against Louis XIV.
Blair could not deny that it was an eminently
righteous war, but he was not thus to be turned
from his purpose. “You must not forget,” said
he, “that people in Virginia have souls to save,
as well as people in England.” “Souls!” cried
Seymour, “damn your souls! Grow tobacco!”
In spite of this discouraging view of the case, the
good doctor persevered until he obtained from
William and Mary the charter that founded the
college ever since known by their names.</p>

<div id="How_Sir_Edmund_Andros_came_as_Nicholsons_successor" class="sidenote">Nicholson

<p>The college was established in 1693, with Blair
for its president.<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> Governor Nicholson, with seventeen
other persons appointed by the assembly,
formed the board of trustees. From the outset
Nicholson was warmly in sympathy with the enterprise,
but now this friend was called away for a
time. In the anti-Catholic fervour which attended
the accession of King William and Queen Mary,
the palatinate government in Maryland had been
overturned, and the new royal governor, Sir Lionel
Copley, died in 1693. Nicholson was then promoted
from deputy-governor of Virginia to be governor
of Maryland. About the same time Lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
Howard of Effingham resigned or was removed,
and Sir Edmund Andros was sent out
to Virginia as governor. It may seem a
strange appointment in view of the obloquy
which Andros had incurred at the
north. But in all these appointments William
III. seems to have acted upon a consistent policy
of not disturbing, except in cases of necessity, the
state of things which he found. As a rule he
retained in his service the old officials against
whom no grave charges were brought; and while
the personality of Andros was not prepossessing,
there can be no doubt as to his integrity.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Andros
quarrels
with Blair.</div>

<p>Nicholson’s career as royal governor of Maryland
lasted until 1698, while Andros was having
a hard time in Virginia trying to enforce with
rigour the Navigation Act and to make life
miserable for Dr. Blair. His conduct
was far more moderate than it had been
in New England, but he had his full
share of trouble in Virginia. The moving cause
of his hostility to the college of William and
Mary is not distinctly assigned, but he is not
unlikely to have believed, like many a dullard of
his stripe, that education is apt to encourage a
seditious and froward spirit. He did everything
he could think of to thwart and annoy President
Blair. At the election of burgesses he predicted
that the establishment of a college would be sure
to result in a terrible increase of taxes. He tried
to persuade subscribers to withhold the payment
of their subscriptions. He sought to arouse an
absurd prejudice against Scotchmen, for which it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
was rather late in the day. Finally he connived
at gross insults to the president and friends of the
college. <span id="How_young_Daniel_Parke_one_Sunday_pulled_Mrs_Blair">Among the young men to whom Andros
showed especial favour was Daniel Parke, whose
grandson, Daniel Parke Custis, is now remembered
as the first husband of Martha Washington. This
young Daniel did some things to which posterity
could hardly point with pride. He is described as
a “sparkish gentleman,” or as some would say a
slashing blade. He was an expert with the rapier
and anxious to thrust it between the ribs of people
who supported the college. His challenges were
numerous, but clergymen could not be reached in
such a way. So “he set up a claim to the pew in
church in which Mrs. Blair sat, and one Sunday,”
as we are told, “with fury and violence he pulled
her out of it in the presence of the minister and
congregation, who were greatly scandalized at this
ruffian and profane action.”</span><a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a></p>

<div id="Removal_of_Andros" class="sidenote">Removal of
Andros.</div>

<p>This was going too far. The stout Scotchman
had powerful friends in London; the outrage was
discussed in Lambeth Palace; and Sir Edmund
Andros, for winking at such behaviour,
was removed. He was evidently a slow-witted
official. His experiences in Boston, with
Parson Willard of the Old South, ought to have
cured him of his propensity to quarrel with aggressive
and resolute clergymen. For two or three
years after going home, Sir Edmund governed the
little channel island of Jersey, and the rest of his
days were spent in retirement, until his death in
1714.

<div id="The_Earl_of_Orkney_draws_a_salary" class="sidenote">Earl of

<p>The system of absentee governors, occasionally
exemplified in such cases as those of Lord Delaware
and Lord Howard, was now to be permanently
adopted. A great favourite with William
III. was George Hamilton Douglas, whose distinguished
gallantry at the battle of the Boyne
and other occasions had been rewarded
with the earldom of Orkney. In 1697
he was appointed governor-in-chief of Virginia,
and for the next forty years he drew his annual
salary of £1,200 without ever crossing the ocean.
Henceforth the official who represented him in
Virginia was entitled lieutenant-governor, and the
first was Francis Nicholson, who was brought back
from Maryland in 1698.</p>

Nicholson.</div>

<div id="Who_removed_the_capital_from_Jamestown" class="sidenote">Founding

<p>One of Nicholson’s achievements in Maryland,
as we shall see in the next chapter, had been the
change of the seat of government from
St. Mary’s to Annapolis. He now proceeded
to make a similar change in Virginia.
After perishing in Bacon’s rebellion, Jamestown
was rebuilt by Lord Culpeper, but in the last
decade of the century it was again destroyed by
an accidental fire, and has never since risen from
its ashes. Of that sacred spot, the first abiding-place
of Englishmen in America, nothing now is
left but the ivy-mantled ruins of the church tower
and a few cracked and crumbling tombstones.
The site of the hamlet is more than half submerged,
and unless some kind of sea-wall is built
to protect it, the unresting tides will soon wash
everything away.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> Jamestown had always a bad
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
reputation for malaria, and after its second burning
people were not eager to restore it. Plans for
moving the government elsewhere had been considered
on more than one occasion. In 1699 the
choice fell upon the site of Middle Plantation,
half way between James and York
rivers, with its salubrious air and wholesome
water. It had already, in 1693, been selected
as the site of the new college.<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> Nicholson called
the place Williamsburg, and began building a
town there with streets so laid out as to make W
and M, the initials of the king and queen, a plan
soon abandoned as inconvenient. The town thus
founded by Nicholson remained the capital of
Virginia until 1780, when it was superseded by
Richmond.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Nicholson
and Blair.</div>

<p>Nicholson was in full sympathy with President
Blair as regarded the college, but occasions for
disagreement between them were at hand. On the
lieutenant-governor’s arrival the wise
parson read him a lesson upon the need
for moderation in the display of his powers. The
career of his predecessor Andros, in more than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
one colony, furnished abundant examples of the
need for such moderation. Blair offered him some
good advice tendered by the Bishop of London,
whereupon Nicholson exclaimed, with a big round
oath, “I know how to govern Virginia and Maryland
better than all the bishops in England. If
I had not hampered them in Maryland and kept
them under, I should never have been able to
govern them.” The doctor replied: “Sir, I do
not pretend to [speak for] Maryland, but if I
know anything of Virginia, they are a good-natured
[and] tractable people as any in the
world, and you may do anything with them by
way of civility, but you will never be able to
manage them in that way you speak of, by hampering
and keeping them under.”<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> The eccentric
governor did not profit by this advice. Of actual
tyranny there was not much in his administration,
but his blustering tongue would give utterance to
extravagant speeches whereat company would sit
“amazed and silent.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">scolding
swain.</div>

<div id="Removal_of_Nicholson" class="sidenote">Removal of
Nicholson.</div>

<p>At last in a laughable way this blustering habit
proved his ruin. Not far from Williamsburg
lived Major Lewis Burwell, who had married a
cousin of the rebel Bacon and had a whole houseful
of blooming daughters. With one of these
young ladies the worshipful governor
fell madly in love, but to his unspeakable
chagrin she promptly and decisively refused
him. Poor Nicholson could not keep the matter
to himself, but raved about it in public. He suspected
that Dr. Blair’s brother was a favoured rival
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
and threatened the whole family with dire vengeance.
He swore that if Miss Burwell should
undertake to marry anybody but himself, he would
“cut the throats of three men: the bridegroom, the
minister, and the justice who issued the license.”
This truculent speech got reported in London, and
one of Nicholson’s friends wrote him a letter counselling
him not to be so unreasonable, but to remember
that English women were the freest in
the world, and that Virginia was not like those
heathen Turkish countries where tender ladies
were dragged into the arms of some pasha still
reeking with the blood of their nearest relatives.
But nothing could quiet the fury of a “governor
scorned;” and one day when he suspected the
minister of Hampton parish of being his rival, he
went up to him and knocked his hat off. This
sort of thing came to be too much for
Dr. Blair; a memorial was sent to Queen
Anne, and Nicholson was recalled to England in
1705. Afterwards we find him commanding the
expedition which in 1710 captured the Acadian
Port Royal from the French. He then served as
governor of the newly conquered Nova Scotia and
afterwards of South Carolina, was knighted, rose
to the rank of lieutenant-general, and died in 1728.</p>

<div id="Fortunes_of_the_college" class="sidenote">The college.</div>

<p>Meanwhile the college of William and Mary, in
which Nicholson felt so much interest,
was flourishing. Unfortunately its first
hall, designed by Sir Christopher Wren, was
destroyed by fire in 1705, but it was before long
replaced by another. Until 1712 the faculty consisted
of the president, a grammar master, writing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
master, and an usher; in that year a professor of
mathematics was added. By 1729 there were six
professors. Fifty years later the departments of
law and medicine were added, and the name “College”
was replaced by “University.”<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a></p>

<div id="Indian_students" class="sidenote">Indian

<p>As in the case of Harvard, it was hoped that
this college might prove effective in converting and
educating Indians. In 1723 Brafferton Hall was
built for their use, from a fund given by Robert
Boyle, the famous chemist. It is still standing
and used as a dormitory. We are told that the
“Queen of Pamunkey” sent her son to
college with a boy to wait upon him, and
likewise two chiefs’ sons, “all handsomely cloathed
after the Indian fashion;”<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> but as to any effects
wrought upon the barbarian mind by this Christian
institution of learning, there is nothing to
which we can point.</p>

<div id="Instructions_to_the_housekeeper" class="sidenote">Instructions
to the housekeeper.</div>

<p>The first Commencement exercises were held in
the year 1700, and it is said that not only were
Virginians and Indians present on that gala day,
but so great was the fame of it that people came
in sloops from Maryland and Pennsylvania, and
even from New York.<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> The journals of what we
may call the “faculty meetings” throw light upon
the manner of living at the college. There is a
matron, or housekeeper, who is thus carefully instructed:
“1. That you never concern
yourself with any of the Boys only when
you have a Complaint against any of
them, and then that you make it to his or their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
proper Master.&mdash;2. That there be always both
fresh and salt Meat for Dinner; and twice in the
Week, as well as on Sunday in particular, that
there be either Puddings or Pies besides; that
there be always Plenty of Victuals; that Breakfast,
Dinner, and Supper be serv’d up in the
cleanest and neatest manner possible; and for this
Reason the Society not only allow but desire you
to get a Cook; that the Boys Suppers be not as
usual made up of different Scraps, but that there
be at each Table the same Sor<sup>t</sup>: and when there is
cold fresh Meat enough, that it be often hashed
for them; that when they are sick, you yourself
see their Victuals before it be carry’d to them,
that it be clean, decent, and fit for them; that the
Person appointed to take Care of them be constantly
with them, and give their Medicine regularly.
The general Complaints of the Visitors,
and other Gentlemen throughout the whole Colony,
plainly shew the Necessity of a strict and
regular Compliance with the above Directions....
4. That a proper Stocking-mender be procured
to live in or near the college, and as both
Masters and Boys complain of losing their Stockings,
you are desired to look over their Notes
given with their Linnen to the Wash, both at the
Delivery and Return of them.... 5. That the
Negroes be trusted with no keys; ... that fresh
Butter be look’d out for in Time, that the Boys
may not be forced to eat salt in Summer.&mdash;6. As
we all know that Negroes will not perform their
Duties without the Mistress’ constant Eye, especially
in so large a Family as the College, and as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
we all observe You going abroad more frequently
then even the Mistress of a private Family can do
without the affairs of her province greatly suffering,
We particularly request it of you, that your
visits for the future in Town and Country may
not be so frequent, by which Means we doubt not
but Complaints will be greatly lessened.”<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a></p>

<div id="Horse_racing_prohibited" class="sidenote">Horse-racing

<p>At another meeting it is ordered “y<sup>t</sup> no scholar

Rank, or Quality, soever, do keep any

severest Animadversion and Punishment.”</p>

<div id="Other_prohibitions" class="sidenote">Other

<p>There is a stress in the wording of this order
which makes one suspect that the faculty had
encountered difficulty in suppressing horse-racing.
Similar orders forbid students to take
part in cock-fighting, to frequent “y<sup>e</sup>
Ordinaries,” to bet, to play at billiards, or to
bring cards or dice into the college. Punishment
is most emphatically threatened for any student
who may “presume to go out of y<sup>e</sup> Bounds of y<sup>e</sup>
College, particularly towards the mill pond” without
express leave; but why the mill pond was to
be so sedulously shunned, we are left to conjecture.
Finally, “to y<sup>e</sup> End y<sup>t</sup> no Person may pretend

<div id="The_story_of_Parson_Camm" class="sidenote">The story
of Parson
Camm.</div>

<p>One of the brightest traditions in the history of
the college is that which tells of the wooing and
wedding of Parson Camm, a gentleman
famous once, whose fame deserves to be
revived. John Camm was born in 1718
and educated at Trinity College, Cambridge.
He was a man of good scholarship and sturdy
character, an uncompromising Tory, one of the
leaders in that “Parsons’ Cause” which made
Patrick Henry famous.<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> He lived to be the
last president of William and Mary before the
Revolution. After he had attained middle age,
but while he was as yet only a preacher and professor,
and like all professors in those days at
William and Mary a bachelor, there came to him
the romance which brightened his life. Among
those who listened to his preaching was Miss Betsy
Hansford, of the family of Hansford the rebel
and martyr. A young friend, who had wooed
Miss Betsy without success, persuaded the worthy
parson to aid him with his eloquence. But it was
in vain that Mr. Camm besieged the young lady
with texts from the Bible enjoining matrimony as
a duty. She proved herself able to beat him at
his own game when she suggested that if the parson
would go home and look at 2 Samuel xii. 7,
he might be able to divine the reason of her obduracy.
When Mr. Camm proceeded to search the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span>
Scriptures he found these significant words staring
him in the face: “And Nathan said to David,
<i>Thou art the man!</i>” The sequel is told in an
item of the Virginia Gazette, announcing the marriage
of Rev. John Camm and Miss Betsy Hansford.<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a></p>

<p>So, Virginia, too, had its Priscilla! In the words
of the sweet mediæval poem:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>But this marriage was an infringement of the customs
of the college, and was rebuked in an order
that <i>hereafter</i> the marriage of a professor should

<p>The college founded by James Blair was a most
valuable centre for culture for Virginia,
and has been remarkable in many ways.
It was the first college in America to
introduce teaching by lectures, and the elective
system of study; it was the first to unite a group
of faculties into a university; it was the second in
the English world to have a chair of Municipal
Law, George Wythe coming to such a professorship
a few years after Sir William Blackstone; it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
was the first in America to establish a chair of
History and Political Science; and it was one of
the first to pursue a thoroughly secular and unsectarian
policy. Though until lately its number
of students at any one time had never reached
one hundred and fifty, it has given to our country
fifteen senators and seventy representatives in
congress; seventeen governors of states, and
thirty-seven judges; three presidents of the United
States,&mdash;Jefferson, Monroe, and Tyler; and the
great Chief Justice Marshall.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a> It was a noble
work for America that was done by the Scotch
parson, James Blair.</p>

<div id="Nicholsons_schemes_for_a_union_of_the_colonies" class="sidenote">Nicholson’s
schemes for
a union of
the colonies.</div>

<p>As for Governor Nicholson, who was so deeply
interested in that work, he played a memorable
part in the history of the United States, which
deserves mention before we leave the subject of
his connection with Virginia. When he was first
transferred from the governorship of New York
to that of the Old Dominion, with his
head full of experiences gained in New
York, he proposed a grand Union of the
English colonies for mutual defence against the
encroachments of the French. King William approved
the scheme and recommended it to the
favourable consideration of the colonial assemblies.
But a desire for union was not strong in any of
these bodies, and as for Virginia, she was too
remote from the Canadian border to feel warmly
interested in it. The act of 1695, authorizing the
governor to apply £500 from the liquor excise to
the relief of New York, shows a notably generous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
spirit in the Virginia burgesses, but the pressure
which was to drive people into a Federal Union
was still in the hidden future. The attitude of
the several colonies so exasperated Nicholson as to
lead him to recommend that they should all be
placed under a single viceroy and taxed for the
support of a standing army. When this plan was
submitted to Queen Anne and her ministers, it
was rejected as unwise, and no British ministry
ever ventured to try any part of such a policy
until the reign of George III. Francis Nicholson
should be remembered as one of the very first to
conceive and suggest the policy that afterward
drove the colonies into their Declaration of Independence.

<div id="Maryland_after_the_death_of_Oliver_Cromwell" class="sidenote">Virginia and
Maryland.</div>

<p>The accession of William and Mary, which
wrought so little change in Virginia, furnished the
occasion for a revolution in the palatinate of
Maryland. To trace the causes of this revolution,
we must return to 1658, the year which
witnessed the death of Oliver Cromwell
and saw Lord Baltimore’s government firmly set
upon its feet through the favour of that mighty
potentate. The compromises which were then
adopted put an end to the conflict between Virginia
and Maryland, and from that time forth the
relations between the two colonies were nearly
always cordial. For the next century the constitutional
development of Maryland proceeded without
interference from Virginia, although on many
occasions the smaller colony was profoundly influenced
by what went on in its larger neighbour,
as well as by those currents of feeling that from
time to time pervaded the English world and
swayed both colonies alike. We shall presently
see, for example, that marked effects were wrought
in Maryland by Bacon’s rebellion, and we shall
observe what various echoes of the political situation
in England were heard in all the colonies,
from the wild scare of the Popish Plot in 1678
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
down to the assured triumph of William III. in
1691, and even later.</p>

<div id="Fuller_and_Fendall" class="sidenote">Fuller and
Fendall.</div>

<p>It will be remembered that when the Puritans
of Providence, in March, 1658, gave in their
assent to the compromises by which Lord Baltimore’s
authority was securely established in Maryland,
only three years had elapsed since their
victory at the Severn had given them supreme
control over the country. While the defeated
Governor Stone languished in jail, the victorious
leader, William Fuller, exercised complete
sway and for a moment could afford
to laugh at the pretensions of Josias Fendall, the
new governor whom Baltimore appointed in 1656.
But this state of things came abruptly to an end
when it was discovered that Lord Baltimore was
upheld by Cromwell. Virginia, with her Puritan
rulers, Bennett and Claiborne and Mathews, was
thus at once detached from the support of Fuller,
so that nothing was left for him but to come to
terms. Fendall’s policy toward his late antagonists
was pacific and generous, so much so that in
the assembly of 1659 we find the names of Fuller
and other Puritan leaders enrolled among the
burgesses. Associated with Fendall, and second
to him in authority, was the secretary and receiver-general,
Philip Calvert, younger brother of
Cecilius, Lord Baltimore.</p>

<div id="The_duty_on_tobacco" class="sidenote">The duty on
tobacco.</div>

<p>After the fires of civil dudgeon had briskly
burned for so many years, it was not strange that
their smouldering embers should send forth a few
fitful gleams before dying. Apart from questions
of religion or of loyalty, there were difficulties in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span>
regard to taxation that can hardly have been
without their effect. There seems to have been
more or less widely diffused a feeling of uneasiness
upon which agitators could play. In 1647 the
assembly had granted to the lord proprietor a
duty of ten shillings per hogshead on all
tobacco exported from the colony. This
grant called forth remonstrances which seem to
have had their effect, as in 1649 the act was
replaced by another which granted to the proprietor
for seven years a similar duty upon all
tobacco exported on Dutch vessels if not bound to
some English port.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> This act seemed to carry with
it the repeal of that of 1647, concerning which it
was silent; if the first act continued in force, the
second was meaningless. During the turbulence
that ensued after 1650 it is not likely that the
revenue laws were rigidly enforced. In 1659
Baltimore directed Fendall to have the act of 1647
explicitly repealed on condition that the assembly
should grant him two shillings per hogshead on
tobacco when shipped to British ports and ten
shillings when shipped to foreign ports. Whether
this demand was popular or not, we may gather
from dates that are more eloquent than words.
The act of 1647 was repealed by the assembly in
1660, but no grant in return was made to the proprietor
until 1671, and then it was a uniform duty
of two shillings. Unless the demand had been
unpopular it would not have been resisted for
eleven years.

<div id="Fendalls_plot" class="sidenote">Fendall’s
plot.</div>

<p>When the assembly met on the last day of
February, 1660, to consider this and other questions,
memorable changes had occurred in England.
The death of mighty Oliver, in September,
1658, threatened the realm with anarchy; and the
prospect for a moment grew darker when in May,
1659, his gentle son Richard dropped the burden
which he had not strength to carry. For nine
months England seemed drifting without compass
or helm. When our assembly met, one notable
thing had just happened, early in February, when
George Monk, “honest old George,” entered London
at the head of his army, and assumed control of
affairs. The news of this event had not yet crossed
the ocean, and even if it had, our Marylanders
would not have understood what it portended.
To some of them it seemed as if in this
season of chaos whoever should seize
upon the government of their little world would
be likely to keep it. So Governor Fendall seems
to have thought, and with him Thomas Gerrard, a
member of the council and a Catholic, but disloyal
to Baltimore. Why should not the government
be held independently of the lord proprietor and
all fees and duties to him be avoided? In this
view of the case Fendall had two or three sympathizers
in the council, and probably a good
many in the House of Burgesses, especially among
the Puritan members, who were in number three
fourths of the whole.</p>

<div id="Temporary_overthrow_of_Baltimores_authority" class="sidenote">Temporary
overthrow
of Baltimore’s
authority.</div>

<p>In the course of the discussion over the tobacco
duty the burgesses sent a message to Governor
Fendall and the council, saying that they judged
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
themselves to be a lawful assembly without dependence
upon any other power now existing
within the province, and if anybody had any objections
to this view of the case they should like
to hear them. The upper house answered by
asking the lower house if they meant that they
were a complete assembly without the upper
house, and also that they were independent of
the lord proprietor. These questions led to a conference,
in which, among other things, Fendall
declared it to be his opinion that laws passed by
the assembly and published in the lord
proprietor’s name should at once be in
full force. Two of the council, Gerrard
and Utie, agreed with this view, while the
secretary, Philip Calvert, and all the rest, dissented.
In these proceedings the governor was
plainly in league with the lower house, and this
vote demonstrated the necessity of getting rid
of the upper house. Accordingly the burgesses
sent word to the governor and council, that they
would not acknowledge them as an upper house,
but they might come and take seats in the lower
house if they liked. Secretary Calvert observed
that in that case the governor would become president
of the joint assembly, and the speaker of the
burgesses must give place to him. A compromise
was presently reached, according to which the
governor should preside, with a casting vote, but
the right of adjourning or dissolving the assembly
should be exercised by the speaker. Hereupon
Calvert protested, and demanded that his protest
be put on record, but Fendall refused. Then Calvert
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
and his most staunch adherent, Councillor
Brooke, requested permission to leave the room.
“You may if you please,” quoth Fendall, “we
shall not force you to go or stay.” With the departure
of these gentlemen the upper house was
virtually abolished, and now Fendall quite threw
off the mask by surrendering his commission from
Lord Baltimore and accepting a new one from
the assembly. Thus the palatinate government
was overthrown, and it only remained for Fendall
and his assembly to declare it felony for anybody
in Maryland to acknowledge Lord Baltimore’s
authority.</p>

<div id="Superficial_resemblance_to_the_action_of_Virginia" class="sidenote">Superficial
resemblance
to the action
of Virginia.</div>

<p>These proceedings in Maryland become perfectly
intelligible if we compare them with what
was going on at the very same moment
in Virginia. In March, 1660, the assembly
at Jamestown, in view of the fact
that there was no acknowledged supreme authority
then resident in England, declared that the supreme
power in Virginia was in the assembly, and
that all writs should issue in its name, until such
command should come from England as the assembly
should judge to be lawful. This assembly
then elected Sir William Berkeley to the governorship,
and he accepted from it provisionally his
commission.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a></p>

<div id="Profound_difference_in_the_situations" class="sidenote">Profound

<div class="sidenote">Fendall’s
error.</div>

<div id="Collapse_of_Fendalls_rebellion" class="sidenote">Collapse
of the
rebellion.</div>

<p>Now in Maryland there was a superficial resemblance
to these proceedings, in so far as the
supreme power was lodged in the assembly and
the governor accepted his commission from it.
But there was a profound difference in the two
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
situations, and while the people of Virginia read
their own situation correctly, Fendall
and his abettors did not. The assembly
at Jamestown was predominantly Cavalier
in its composition and in full sympathy with
the expected restoration of the monarchy; and its
proceedings were promptly sanctioned by Charles
II., whose royal commission to Sir William Berkeley
came in October of the same year. On the
other hand, the assembly at St. Mary’s was predominantly
Puritan in its composition, and one of
its most influential members was that William
Fuller who five years before had defeated Lord
Baltimore’s governor in the battle of the Severn,
and executed drumhead justice upon several of
his adherents. The election had been managed
in the interest of the Puritans, as is shown by
Fuller’s county, Anne Arundel, returning seven
delegates, whereas it was only entitled to four.
The collusion between Fuller and Fendall is unmistakable.
For two years the Puritans had acquiesced
in Lord Baltimore’s rule, because they
had not dared resist Cromwell. Now if Puritanism
were to remain uppermost in England, they
might once more hope to overthrow him;
if the monarchy were to be restored, the
prospect was also good, for it did not seem likely
that Charles II. would befriend the man whom
Cromwell had befriended. Here was the fatal
error of Fendall and his people. Charles II. had
long ago recovered from his little tiff with Cecilius
for appointing a Parliamentarian governor, and as
a Romanist at heart he was more than ready to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
show favour to Catholics. Thus with rare good
fortune&mdash;defended in turn by a king and a lord
protector, and by another king, and aided at every
turn by his own consummate tact, did Cecilius
triumphantly weather all the storms. When the
news of Fendall’s treachery reached London it
found Charles II. seated firmly on the throne.
All persons were at once instructed to respect
Lord Baltimore’s authority over Maryland, and
Sir William Berkeley was ordered to bring the
force of Virginia to his aid if necessary;
Cecilius appointed his brother Philip to
the governorship; the rebellion instantly
collapsed, and its ringleaders were seized. Vengeance
was denounced against Fendall and Fuller
and all who had been concerned in the execution
of Baltimore’s men after the battle of the Severn.
Philip Calvert was instructed to hang them all,
and to proclaim martial law if necessary, but on
second thought so much severity was deemed impolitic.
Such punishments were inflicted as banishment,
confiscation, and loss of civil rights, but
nobody was put to death. Such was the end of
Fendall’s rebellion. In the course of the year
1661, Cecilius sent over his only son, Charles
Calvert, to be governor of the palatinate, while
Philip remained as chancellor; and this arrangement
continued for many years.</p>

<div id="The_Quakers" class="sidenote">The
Quakers.</div>

<p>Fendall’s administration had witnessed two
events of especial interest, in the arrival of Quakers
in the colony and of Dutchmen in
a part of its territory. Quakers came
from Massachusetts and Virginia, where they suffered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
so much ill usage, into Maryland, where they
also got into trouble, though it does not appear
that the objections against them were of a religious
nature. The peculiar notions of the Quakers often
brought them into conflict with governments on
purely civil grounds, as when they refused to be
enrolled in the militia, or to serve on juries, or
give testimony under oath. For such reasons, two
zealous Quaker preachers, Thurston and Cole,
were arrested and tried in 1658, but it does not
appear that they were treated with harshness or
that at any time there was anything like persecution
of Quakers in Maryland. When George Fox
visited the country in 1672, his followers there
were numerous and held regular meetings.</p>

and Dutch.</div>

<div id="Augustine_Herman" class="sidenote">Augustine
Herman.</div>

<div id="Bohemia_Manor" class="sidenote">Bohemia
Manor.</div>

<p>With the arrival of Quakers there appeared on
the northeastern horizon a menace from the Dutch,
and incidents occurred that curiously affected the
future growth of Lord Baltimore’s princely domain.
Since 1638 parties of Swedes
had been establishing themselves on the
western bank of the Delaware River, on and about
the present sites of Newcastle and Wilmington.
This region they called New Sweden, but in 1655
Peter Stuyvesant despatched from Manhattan a
force of Dutchmen which speedily overcame the
little colony. Stuyvesant then divided his conquest
into two provinces, which he called New
Amstel and Altona, and appointed a governor
over each. It was now Maryland’s turn to be
aroused. The governor of New Netherland had
no business to be setting up jurisdictions west
of Delaware River. That whole region was expressly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
included in Lord Baltimore’s charter.
Accordingly the Dutch governors of New Amstel
and Altona were politely informed that they must
either acknowledge Baltimore’s jurisdiction or
leave the country. This led to Stuyvesant’s sending
an envoy to St. Mary’s, to discuss the proprietorship
of the territory in question. The
person selected for this business was a man of no
ordinary mould, a native of Prague, with
the German name of Augustine Herman.
He came to New Amsterdam at some time before
1647, in which year he was appointed one of the
Nine Men whose business it was to advise the
governor. This Herman was a man of broad
intelligence, rare executive ability, and perfect
courage. He was by profession a land surveyor
and draughtsman, but in the course of his life he
accumulated a great fortune by trade. His portrait,
painted from life, shows us a masterful face,
clean shaven, with powerful jaw, firm-set lips,
imperious eyes, and long hair flowing upon his
shoulders over a red coat richly ruffled.<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> Such
was the man whom Stuyvesant chose to dispute
Lord Baltimore’s title to the smiling fields of
New Amstel and Altona. He well understood the
wisdom of claiming everything, and when the discovery
of North America by John Cabot was cited
against him, he boldly set up the priority of
Christopher Columbus as giving the Spaniards a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
claim upon the whole hemisphere. To the Dutch,
he said, as victors over their wicked stepmother
Spain, her claims had naturally passed! One is
inclined to wonder if such an argument was announced
without something like a twinkle in those
piercing eyes. At all events, it was not long
before the astute ambassador abandoned his logic
and changed his allegiance. Romantic tradition
has assigned various grounds for Herman’s leaving
New Amsterdam. Whether it was because of
a quarrel with Stuyvesant, and whether the quarrel
had its source in love of woman or love of pelf,
we know not; but in 1660 Herman wrote to Lord
Baltimore, asking for the grant of a manor, and
offering to pay for it by making a map of Maryland.
The proposal was accepted. The map,
which was completed after careful surveys extending
over ten years and was engraved in London
in 1673, with a portrait of Herman attached,
is still preserved in the British Museum. For
this important service the enterprising surveyor
received an estate on the Elk River,
which by successive accretions came to
include more than 20,000 acres.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> It is still called
by the name which Herman gave it, Bohemia
Manor. There he grew immensely rich by trade
with the Indians along the very routes which
Claiborne had hoped to monopolize, and there in
his great manor house, in spite of matrimonial
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
infelicities like those of Socrates and the elder
Mr. Weller, he lived to a good old age and dispensed
a regal hospitality, in which the items of
rum and brandy, strong beer, sound wines, and
“best cider out of the orchard” were not forgotten.
Herman’s tomb is still to be seen hard by the
vestiges of his house and his deer park. Six of
his descendants succeeded him as lords of Bohemia
Manor, until its legal existence came to an end in
1789. The fact is not without interest that Margaret
Shippen, wife of Benedict Arnold, counted
among her ancestors the sturdy Augustine Herman.</p>

<div id="The_Labadists" class="sidenote">The
Labadists.</div>

<p>A noteworthy episode in the history of Bohemia
Manor is the settlement of a small sect of Mystics,
known as Labadists, from the name of
their French founder, Jean de Labadie.
Their professed aim was to restore the simplicity
of life and doctrine attributed to the primitive
Christians. Their views of spiritual things were
brightened by an inward light, their drift of
thought was toward antinomianism, they held all
goods in common, and their notions about marriage
were such as to render them liable to be
molested on civil grounds. The persistent recurrence
of such little communities, age after age,
each one ignorant of the existence of its predecessors
and supremely innocent of all knowledge of
the world, is one of the interesting freaks in religious
history. Even in the tolerant atmosphere
of Holland these Labadists led an uneasy life, and
in 1679 two of their brethren, Sluyter and Dankers,
came over to New York, to make fresh
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
converts and find a new home. One of their first
converts was Ephraim, the weak-minded son of
Augustine Herman, and it may have been through
the son’s persuasion that the father was induced
to grant nearly 4,000 acres of his manor to the
community. A company settled there in 1683
and were joined by persons from New York. As
often happens in such communities the affair
ended in a despotism, in which the people were
ruled with a rod of iron by Brother Sluyter and
his wife, who set themselves up as a kind of abbot
and abbess. On Sluyter’s death in 1722 the sect
seems to have come to an end, but to this day the
land is known as “the Labadie tract.”</p>

<div id="The_Duke_of_York_takes_possession_of_the_Delaware_settlements" class="sidenote">The Duke of
York takes

settlements.</div>

<p id="And_granted_New_Jersey_to_Lord_Berkeley_and_Sir_George_Carteret">Long before Augustine Herman’s death, Lord
Baltimore had granted him a second estate, called
the manor of St. Augustine, extending eastward
from Bohemia Manor to the shore of Delaware
Bay; but to the greater part of it the Herman
family never succeeded in making good their title,
for the territory passed out of Lord Baltimore’s
domain. Once more the heedlessness and bad
faith of the Stuart kings, in their grants of
American lands, was exhibited, and as Baltimore’s
patent had once encroached upon the Virginians,
so now he was encroached upon by the
Duke of York and presently by William
Penn. The province of New Netherland,
which Charles II. took from the Dutch
in 1664 and bestowed upon his brother as lord
proprietor, extended from the upper waters of the
Hudson down to Cape May at the entrance to
Delaware Bay, but did not include a square foot
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
of land on the west shore of the bay, since all that
was expressly included in the Maryland charter.
It was not to be expected that Swedes or Dutchmen
would pay any heed to that English charter;
but it might have been supposed that Charles II.
and his brother James would have shown some
respect for a contract made by their father. Not
so, however. The little Swedish and Dutch settlements
on the west shore were at once taken in
charge by officers of the Duke of York, as if they
had belonged to his domain of New Netherland,
while the southern part of that domain was
granted by him, under the name of New Jersey,
to his friends, Lord Berkeley and Sir George
Carteret.</p>

<div id="Charter_of_Pennsylvania" class="sidenote">Charter of
Pennsylvania.</div>

<p id="Which_resulted_in_the_bringing_of_William_Penn_upon_the_scene">Nothing more of consequence occurred for several
years, in the course of which interval, in 1675,
Cecilius Calvert died and was succeeded by his
son Charles, third Lord Baltimore. Not long afterward
William Penn appeared on the scene, at first
as trustee of certain Quaker estates in New Jersey,
but presently as ruler over a princely domain of
his own. The Quakers had been ill treated in
many of the colonies; why not found a colony in
which they should be the leaders? The suggestion
offered to Charles II. an easy way of paying an
old debt of £16,000 owed by the crown to the
estate of the late Admiral Penn, and accordingly
William was made lord proprietor of a
spacious country lying west of the Delaware
River and between Maryland to the
south and the Five Nations to the north. His
charter created a government very similar to Lord
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
Baltimore’s but far less independent, for laws
passed in Pennsylvania must be sent to England
for the royal assent, and the British government,
which fifty years before had expressly renounced
the right to lay taxes upon Marylanders, now
expressly asserted the right to lay taxes upon
Pennsylvanians. This change marks the growth
of the imperial and anti-feudal sentiment in England,
the feeling that privileges like those accorded
to the Calverts were too extensive to be enjoyed
by subjects.</p>

<div id="Boundaries_between_Penn_and_Baltimore" class="sidenote">Boundaries
between
Penn and
Baltimore.</div>

<p>According to Lord Baltimore’s charter his northern
boundary was the fortieth parallel
of latitude, which runs a little north of
the site of Philadelphia. The latitude
was marked by a fort erected on the Susquehanna
River, and when the crown lawyers consulted with
Baltimore’s attorneys, they were informed that all
questions of encroachment would be avoided if the
line were to be run just north of this fort, so as to
leave it on the Maryland side.<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Penn made no
objection to this, but when the charter was drawn
up no allusion was made to the Susquehanna fort.
Penn’s southern boundary was made to begin
twelve miles north of Newcastle, thence to curve
northwestward to the fortieth parallel and follow
that parallel. Measurement soon showed that such
a boundary would give Penn’s province inadequate
access to the sea. His position as a royal favourite
enabled him to push the whole line twenty miles
to the south. Even then he was disappointed in
not gaining the head of Chesapeake Bay, and,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span>
being bent upon securing somewhere a bit of seacoast,
he persuaded the Duke of York to give him
the land on the west shore of Delaware Bay which
the Dutch had once taken from the Swedes. By
further enlargement the area of this grant became
that of the present state of Delaware, the whole of
which was thus, in spite of vehement protest, carved
out of the original Maryland. In such matters there
was not much profit in contending against princes.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div id="Old_manors_in_Maryland" class="sidenote">Old manors
in Maryland.</div>

<p>In the course of this narrative we have had
occasion to mention the grants of Bohemia and
other manors. In order that we should understand
the course of Maryland history before and
after the Revolution of 1689, some description of
the manorial system is desirable. One of
the most interesting features in the early
history of English America is the way in which
different phases of English institutions were reproduced
in the different colonies. As the ancient
English town meeting reached a high development
in New England, as the system of close vestries
was very thoroughly worked out in Virginia, so
the old English manor was best preserved in
Maryland. In 1636 Lord Baltimore issued instructions
that every grant of 2,000 acres or more
should be erected into a manor, with court baron
and court leet. “The manor was the land on
which the lord and his tenants lived, and bound
up with the land were also the rights of government
which the lord possessed over the tenants,
and they over one another.”<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a> Such manors were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
scattered all over tidewater Maryland. Mr. Johnson,
in his excellent essay on the subject, cites at
random the names of “George Evelin, lord of the
manor of Evelinton, in St. Mary’s county; Marmaduke
Tilden, lord of Great Oak Manor, and
Major James Ringgold, lord of the manor on
Eastern Neck, both in Kent; Giles Brent, lord of
Kent Fort, on Kent Island; George Talbot, lord
of Susquehanna Manor, in Cecil county,” and he
mentions a sale, in 1767, of “twenty-seven manors,
embracing 100,000 acres.”</p>

<div id="Life_on_the_manors" class="sidenote">Life in the
manors.</div>

<p>In the life upon these manors there was a kind
of patriarchal completeness; each was a
little world in itself. There was the
great house with its generous dining-hall, its
panelled wainscoat, and its family portraits; there
was the chapel, with the graves of the lord’s family
beneath its pavement and the graves of common
folk out in the churchyard; there were the smoke-houses,
and the cabins of negro slaves; and here
and there one might come upon the dwellings of
white freehold tenants, with ample land about
them held on leases of one-and-twenty years. In
establishing these manors, Lord Baltimore had an
eye to the military defence of his colony. It was
enacted in 1641 that the grant of a manor should
be the reward for every settler who should bring
with him from England twenty able-bodied men,
each armed with a musket, a sword and belt, a
bandelier and flask, ten pounds of powder, and
forty pounds of bullets and shot.</p>

<div id="The_court_leet" class="sidenote">The court
leet.</div>

<p>These manors were little self-governing communities.
The court leet was like a town meeting.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
All freemen could take part in it. It enacted
by-laws, elected constables, bailiffs, and
other local officers, set up stocks and
pillory, and sentenced offenders to stand there,
for judicial and legislative functions were united
in this court leet. It empanelled its jury, and
with the steward of the manor presiding as judge,
it visited with fine or imprisonment the thief, the
vagrant, the poacher, the fraudulent dealer.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The court
baron.</div>

<p>Side by side with the court leet was the court
baron, an equally free institution in which all the
freehold tenants sat as judges determining
questions of law and of fact. This
court decided all disputes between the lord and
his tenants concerning such matters as rents, or
trespass, or escheats. Here actions for debt were
tried, and transfers of land were made with the
ancient formalities.</p>

<div id="Changes_wrought_by_slavery" class="sidenote">Changes
wrought by
slavery.</div>

<p>These admirable manorial institutions were
brought to Maryland in precisely the same shape
in which they had long existed in England. They
were well adapted for preserving liberty and
securing order in rural communities before the
days of denser population and more rapid communication.
In our progress away from those
earlier times we have gained vastly, but it is by
no means sure that we have not also lost something.
In the decadence of the Maryland manors
there was clearly an element of loss, for that
decadence was chiefly brought about by
the growth of negro slavery, which made
it more profitable for the lord of the
manor to cultivate the whole of it himself, instead
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
of leasing the whole or parts of it to tenants.
Slavery also affixed a stigma upon free labour and
drove it off the field, very much as a debased
currency invariably drives out a sound currency.
From these causes the class of freehold tenants
gradually disappeared, “the feudal society of the
manor” was transformed into “the patriarchal
society of the plantation,”<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> and the arbitrary fiat

<div id="A_fierce_spirit_of_liberty" class="sidenote">A fierce

<p>Among the people of Lord Baltimore’s colony,
as among English-speaking people in general, one
might observe a fierce spirit of political
liberty coupled with engrained respect
for law and a disposition to achieve results
by argument rather than by violence. Such
a temper leads to interminable parliamentary discussion,
and in the reign of Charles II. the tongues
of the Maryland assembly were seldom quiet. As
compared with the stormy period before 1660, the
later career of Cecilius and that of his son Charles
down to the Revolution of 1689 seem peaceful,
and there are writers who would persuade us that
when the catastrophe arrived, it came quite unheralded,
like lightning from a cloudless sky. A
perusal of the transactions in the Maryland
assembly, however, shows that the happy period
was not so serene as we have been told, but there
were fleecy specks on the horizon, with now and
then a faint growl of distant thunder.</p>

<div id="Cecilius_and_Charles" class="sidenote">Cecilius and

<p>That the proprietary government had many
devoted friends is not to be denied, and it is clear
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
that some of the opposition to it was merely
factious. There is no doubt as to the lofty personal
qualities of the second Lord Baltimore, his
courage and sagacity, his disinterested public
spirit, his devotion to the noble ideal
which he had inherited. As for Charles,
the third lord, he seems to have been a paler
reflection of his father, like him for good intentions,
but far inferior in force. The period of
eight-and-twenty years which we are considering,
from 1661 to 1689, is divided exactly in the
middle by the death of Cecilius in 1675. Before
that date we have Charles administering the affairs
of Maryland subject to the approval of his father
in London; after that date Charles is supreme.</p>

<div id="A_pleasant_little_family_party" class="sidenote">The family
party</div>

<p>Now the circumstances were such that father
and son would have had to be more than human
to carry on the government without serious opposition.
In the first place, they were Catholics,
ruling a population in which about one
twelfth part were Catholics, while one
sixth belonged to the Church of England, and
three fourths were dissenting Puritans. To most
of the people the enforced toleration of Papists
must have seemed like keeping on terms of polite
familiarity with the devil. In the second place,
the proprietor was apt to appoint his own relatives
and trusted friends to the highest offices, and such
persons were usually Catholics. As these high
officers composed the council, or upper house of
the assembly, the proprietor had a permanent
and irreversible majority in that body. When
we read the minutes of a council composed of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
Governor Charles Calvert, his uncle Philip, his
cousin William, Mr. Baker Brooke, who had married
cousin William’s sister, Mr. William Talbot,
who was another cousin, and Mr. Henry Coursey,
who was uncle Philip’s bosom friend, we
seem to be assisting at a pleasant little
family party. Again, when the governor marries
a widow, and each of his five stepchildren marries,
and we are told that “every one who became
related to the family soon obtained an office,”<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> we
begin to realize that there was coming to be quite
a clan to be supported from the revenues of a
small province. Nepotism may not be the blackest
of crimes, but it is pretty certain to breed trouble.</p>

<div id="Conflict_in_the_assembly" class="sidenote">Conflict in
the assembly.</div>

<p>The governing power opposed to this family
party was the House of Burgesses, or lower house
of assembly. Those freeholding tenants and small
proprietors who had brought with them from England
their time-honoured habits of self-government
in court leet and court baron, represented the
democratic element in the constitution of
Maryland, as the upper house represented
the oligarchical element. The
history of the period we are considering is the
history of a constitutional struggle between the
two houses. We have seen that it was not a part
of the proprietor’s original scheme that the assembly
should take an initiative in legislation, and
that on this ground he refused his assent to the
first group of laws sent to him in 1635 for his
signature. Apparently it was his idea that his
burgesses should simply comment on acts passed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
by their betters, as on old Merovingian fields of
March the magnates legislated while the listening
warriors clashed their shields in token of approval.
If such was the first notion of Cecilius he promptly
relinquished it and gracefully conceded the claim
of the assembly to take the initiative in legislation.
But the veto power, without any limitation
of time, was a prerogative which he would not
give up. At any moment he could use this veto
power to repeal a law, and this was felt by the
colonists to be a grievance. On such constitutional
matters, when we read of antagonism between the
proprietor and the assembly, it is the burgesses
that we are to understand as in opposition, since
the council was almost sure to uphold the proprietor.</p>

<div id="Rights_of_the_burgesses" class="sidenote">Rights of
the burgesses.</div>

<p id="How_Rev_Charles_Nichollet_was_fined_for_preaching_politics">One point upon which the upper house always
insisted was that the burgesses were not a house
of commons with inherent rights of legislation,
but that they owed their existence to the charter,
with powers that must be limited as strictly as
possible. But this point the burgesses
would never concede. They were Englishmen,
with the rights and privileges
of Englishmen, and it was an inherent right in
English representatives to make laws for their
constituents; accordingly they insisted that they
were, to all intents and purposes, a house of
commons for Maryland.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a> On one occasion a clergyman,
Charles Nichollet, preached a sermon, in
which he warned the burgesses not to forget that
they had no real liberty unless they could pass
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
laws that were agreeable to their conscience; as
a house of commons they must keep their hand
upon the purse strings and consider if the taxes
were not too heavy. The family party of the
upper house called such talk seditious, and the
parson was roundly fined for preaching politics.</p>

<div id="Cessation_Act_of_1668" class="sidenote">Cessation
Act of 1668.</div>

<p>But it would be grossly unfair to the proprietor
to overlook the fact that on some important occasions
he took sides with the representatives of the
people against his own little family party. As an
instance may be cited the act of 1666
concerning the “Cessation of Tobacco.”
As the fees of public officials were paid in tobacco,
a large crop was liable to diminish their
value, and accordingly the upper house wished
to contract the currency by an act stopping all
planting of tobacco for one year. The lower
house objected to this, but after a long dispute
was induced to give consent, provided Virginia
should pass a similar act. The speaker, however,
wrote to Cecilius urging him to veto the act, and
he did so.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a></p>

<div id="Sheriffs" class="sidenote">Sheriffs.</div>

<p>The occasions of difference between the two
houses were many and various. One concerned
the relief of Quakers. In Rhode Island, New
Jersey, and Jamaica, they were allowed to make
affirmations instead of taking oaths. When the
Quakers of Maryland petitioned for a similar relief,
the burgesses granted it, but the council
refused to concur. A more important
matter was the appointment of sheriffs.
In addition to the ordinary functions of the sheriff,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
with which we are familiar in more modern times,
these officers collected all taxes, superintended all
elections, and made out the returns. These were
formidable powers, for a dishonest or intriguing
sheriff might alter the composition of the House
of Burgesses. Sheriffs were appointed by the
governor, and were in no way responsible to the
county courts. The burgesses tried to establish a
check upon them by enacting that the county court
should recommend three persons out of whom the
governor should choose one, and that the sheriff
thus selected should serve for one year; but the
upper house declared that such an act infringed
the proprietor’s prerogative. No check upon the
sheriffs, therefore, was left to the people except
the regulating of their fees, and upon this point
the burgesses were stiff.</p>

<div id="Restriction_of_suffrage_1670" class="sidenote">Restriction
of suffrage,
1670.</div>

<p>In 1669 the disputes between the houses were
more stormy than usual, and in the election of the
next year the suffrage was restricted to freemen
owning plantations of fifty acres or more, or possessed
of personal property to the amount
of £50 sterling. This restriction was
not accomplished by legislation; it must
have been a sheer assertion of prerogative, either
by Cecilius or by Charles acting on his own responsibility.
All that is positively known is that
the sheriffs were instructed to that effect in their
writs. It is worthy of note that a similar restriction
of suffrage had just occurred in Virginia.
Perhaps Charles Calvert was imprudently taking
a lesson from Berkeley. But still worse, in summoning
to the assembly the members who had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
been elected, he omitted a few names, presumably
those of persons whose opposition was likely to
prove inconvenient. When the burgesses demanded
the reason for this omission, Charles made
a shuffling explanation which they saw fit to accept
for the moment, and thus a precedent was
created of which he was not slow to avail himself,
and from which endless bickering ensued. For
the present a house of burgesses was obtained
which was much to the governor’s liking; accordingly,
instead of allowing its term to expire at the
end of a year, he simply adjourned it, and thus
kept it alive until 1676,&mdash;another lesson learned
from Berkeley.</p>

<p>It was this comparatively submissive assembly
that in 1671 passed the act which for eleven years
had been resisted, granting to the proprietor a
royalty of two shillings on every hogshead of tobacco
exported. In return for this grant,
however, the lower house obtained some
concessions. With the death of Cecilius,
in 1675, the situation was certainly changed for the
worse. Now for the first time the people of Maryland
had their lord proprietor dwelling among
them and not in England; but Charles was narrower
and less public-spirited than his father, his
measures were more arbitrary, and the feeling that
the country was governed in the interests of a
small coterie of Papists rapidly increased. In
1676 Maryland seemed on the point of following
Virginia into rebellion. Lord Baltimore went to
England in the spring, and by midsummer it had
become evident that Bacon had able sympathizers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
in Maryland. A set of manuscript archives, recently
recovered from long oblivion,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> make it probable
that but for Bacon’s sudden death in October
and the collapse of the movement in Virginia,
there would have been bloodshed in the sister colony.
In August a seditious paper was circulated,
alleging grievances similar to those of Virginia,
and threatening the proprietor’s government.
Two gentlemen named Davis and
Pate, with others, gathered an armed
force in Calvert county with the design of intimidating
the governor and council, and extorting
from them sundry concessions. When the governor,
Thomas Notley, ordered them to disband,
promising that their demands should be duly considered
at the next assembly, they refused on the
ground that the assembly had been tampered
with and no longer represented the people. As
Notley afterward wrote to Lord Baltimore, never
was there a people “more replete with malignancy
and frenzy than our people were about August
last, and they wanted but a monstrous head to
their monstrous body.” But this incipient Davis
and Pate rebellion derived its strength from the
Bacon rebellion, and the collapse of the
one extinguished the other. Davis and
Pate were hanged, at which Notley tells
us the people were “terrified,” and so peace was
preserved.</p>

<div id="George_Talbot" class="sidenote">George
Talbot.</div>

<p>An episode which occurred before the final catastrophe
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
throws some light upon the relations of
parties at the time. An Irish kinsman of Lord
Baltimore’s, by name George Talbot, obtained
in 1680 an extensive grant of land
on the Susquehanna River, where he lived in feudal
style, with a force of Irish retainers at his
beck and call, hunting venison, drinking strong
waters, browbeating Indians, and picking quarrels
with William Penn’s newly arrived followers. In
1684 Lord Baltimore went again to England, leaving
his son, Benedict Calvert, in the governorship;
and as Benedict was a mere boy, there was a little
regency of which George Talbot was the head.
Now the exemption of Maryland from king’s
taxes did not extend to custom-house duties.
These were collected by crown officers and paid
into the royal treasury; and the collectors were
apt to behave themselves, as in all ages and countries,
like enemies of the human race. Between
them and the proprietary government there was
deep-seated antipathy. They accused Lord Baltimore
of hindering them in their work, and this
complaint led the king to pounce upon him with a
claim for £2,500 alleged to have been lost to the
revenue through his interferences. One of these
collectors, Christopher Rousby, was especially overbearing,
and some called him a rascal. Late in
1684 a small ship of the royal navy was lying at
St. Mary’s, and one day, while Rousby was in the
cabin drinking toddies with the captain, Talbot
came on board, and a quarrel ensued, in the course
of which Talbot drew a dagger and plunged it into
Rousby’s heart. The captain refused to allow
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
Talbot to go ashore to be tried by a council of his
relatives; he carried him to Virginia and handed
him over to the governor, Lord Howard of Effingham.
Talbot was imprisoned not far from the
site where once had stood the red man’s village,
Werowocomoco, where he was in imminent danger
of the gallows, or perhaps of having to pay his whole
fortune as a bribe to the greedy Howard. But Talbot’s
brave wife, with two trusty followers, sailed
down the whole length of Chesapeake Bay and up
York River in a boat. On a dark winter’s night
they succeeded in freeing Talbot from his jail, and
returning as they came, carried him off exulting to
Susquehanna Manor. For the sake of appearances
his friends in the Maryland council thought it
necessary to proclaim the hue and cry after him,
and there is a local tradition that he was for
a while obliged to hide in a cave, where a couple
of his trained hawks kept him alive by fetching
him game&mdash;canvas-back ducks, perhaps, and terrapin&mdash;from
the river! It is not likely, however,
that the search for him was zealous or thorough.
For some time he staid unmolested in his manor
house, but presently deemed it prudent to go and
surrender himself. The council refused to bring
him to trial in any court held in the king’s name,
until a royal order came from England to send
him over there for trial, but before this was done
Lord Baltimore interceded with James II. and
secured a pardon.</p>

<div id="A_Complaint_from_Heaven" class="sidenote">A “Complaint
from
Heaven.”</div>

<p>The general effect of this Talbot affair was to
weaken the palatinate government by making it
appear lukewarm in its allegiance and remiss in its
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
duties to the crown. The custom-house became a
subject of hot discussion, and the charges of defrauding
the royal revenue were reiterated with
effect. Some time before this, a remarkable pamphlet
had appeared with the title, “Complaint
from Heaven with a Huy and
Crye and a petition out of Virginia and
Maryland.” It was evidently written by some
Puritan friend of Fendall’s. After a bitter denunciation
of the palatinate administration some
measures of relief were suggested, one of which was
that the king should assume the government of
Maryland and appoint the governors. The time was
now at hand when this suggestion was to bear fruit.</p>

<div id="The_anti_Catholic_panic_of_1689" class="sidenote">The anti-Catholic
panic.</div>

<p>The forced abdication of James II. in 1688, with
his flight to France, was the occasion of
an anti-Catholic panic throughout the
greater part of English America. It was
as certain as anything future could be that the
antagonism between Louis XIV. and William of
Orange would at once break out in a great war, in
which French armies from Canada would invade
the English colonies. There was a widespread
fear that Papists in these colonies would turn
traitors and assist the enemy. It was in this scare
that Leisler’s rebellion in New York originated,
although there too a conflict between democracy
and oligarchy was concerned, somewhat as in Maryland.
Everywhere the ordinary dread of Papists
became more acute. It was soon after this time
that the clause of an act depriving Roman Catholics
of the franchise found its way into the Rhode
Island statutes, the only instance in which that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
commonwealth ever allowed itself to depart from
the noble principles of Roger Williams.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a></p>

<div id="Causes_of_the_panic" class="sidenote">Causes of
the panic.</div>

<p>While there were absurdities in this anti-Catholic
panic, it contained an element that was not
unreasonable. Throughout the century the Papist
counter-reformation had made alarming progress.
In France, the strongest nation in the
world, it had just scored a final victory
in the expulsion of the Huguenots. In Germany
the Thirty Years’ War had left Protestantism
weaker than it had been at the death of Martin
Luther. England had barely escaped from having
a Papist dynasty settled upon her; nor was it
yet sure that she had escaped. A caprice of fortune
might drive King William out as suddenly
as he had come. Ireland still held out for the
Stuarts, and there in May, 1689, James II. landed
with French troops, in the hope of winning back
his crown. The officer who held Ireland for
James was Richard Talbot, Duke of Tyrconnel, a
distant relative and intimate friend of Lord Baltimore.
Under these circumstances a panic was
natural. There were absurd rumours of a plot
between Catholics and Indians to massacre Protestants.
More reasonable was the jealous eagerness
with which men watched the council to see
what it would do about proclaiming William and
Mary. Lord Baltimore was prompt in sending
from London directions to the council to proclaim
them; whatever his political leanings might have
been, he could in prudence hardly do less. But
the messenger died on the voyage, and a second
messenger was too late.

<p>Meanwhile, in April, 1689, there was formed
“An Association in arms for the defense of the
Protestant Religion, and for asserting the right of
King William and Queen Mary to the Province of
Maryland and all the English Dominions.” The
president of this association was John
Coode, who had married a daughter of
that Thomas Gerrard who took a part
in Fendall’s rebellion. Another leader, who had
married another daughter of Gerrard, was Nehemiah
Blackiston, collector of customs, who had
been foremost in accusing the Calverts of obstructing
his work. Others were Kenelm Cheseldyn,
speaker of the house, and Henry Jowles, colonel
of the militia. As the weeks passed by, and news
of the proclaiming of William and Mary by one
colony after another arrived, and still the council
took no action in the matter, people grew impatient
and the association kept winning recruits.
At last, toward the end of July, Coode appeared
before St. Mary’s at the head of 700 armed men.
No resistance was offered. The council fled to a
fort on the Patuxent River, where they were
besieged and in a few days surrendered. Coode
detained all outward-bound ships until he had
prepared an account of these proceedings to
send to King William in the name of the Protestant
inhabitants of Maryland. Like the insurrection
in Boston, three months earlier, which
overthrew Sir Edmund Andros, this bold stroke
wore the aspect of a rising against the deposed
king in favour of the king actually reigning.
William was asked to undertake the government
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
of Maryland, and the whole affair met with his approval.
He issued a <i>scire facias</i> against
the Baltimore charter, and before a decision
had been reached in the court of
chancery he sent out Sir Lionel Copley in 1691, to
be royal governor of Maryland. In such wise was
the palatinate overturned.</p>

<p id="But_did_not_thereby_bring_the_millennium">If any party in Maryland expected the millennium
to follow this revolution, they were disappointed.
Taxes were straightway levied
for the support of the Church of England,
the further immigration of Catholics was
prohibited under heavy penalties, and the public
celebration of the mass was strictly forbidden
within the limits of the colony. When Governor
Nicholson arrived upon the scene, in 1694, he
summoned his first assembly to meet at the Anne
Arundel town formerly known as Providence;
and in the course of that session it was
decided to move the seat of government
thither from St. Mary’s. The purpose
was to deal a blow at the old capital, the social
and political centre of Catholicism in Maryland.
Bitter indignation was felt at St. Mary’s, and a
petition signed by the mayor and other municipal
officers, with a number of the freemen, was sent
to the assembly, praying that the change might be
reconsidered. The House of Burgesses returned
an answer, brutal and vulgar in tone, which shows
the wellnigh incredible virulence of political passion
in those days.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> The blow was final, so far as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
St. Mary’s was concerned. Her civic life had
evidently depended upon the presence of the government.
At one time, with its fifty or sixty
houses, the little city founded by Leonard Calvert
was much larger than Jamestown; but after the
removal it dwindled till little was left save a memory.
The name of the new capital on the Severn
was doubtless felt to be cumbrous, for it was presently
changed to Annapolis,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a> the first of a set of
queer hybrid compounds with which the map of
the United States is besprinkled. Nicholson wished
to crown the work of founding a new capital by
establishing a school or college there, and accordingly
in 1696 King William School was founded.
For many years the income for supporting this
and other free schools was derived from an export
duty on furs.<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a></p>

<p>The change of the capital was perhaps bewailed
only by the Catholics and others who were most
strongly attached to the proprietary government.
But the change in ecclesiastical policy
disgusted everybody. Taxation for the
support of the Episcopal church, of which
only a small part of the population were
members, was as unpopular with Puritans as with
Papists. The Puritans, who had worked so zealously
to undermine the proprietary government,
had not bargained for such a result as this. The
manner in which the church revenue was raised
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
was also extremely irritating. The rate was forty
pounds of tobacco per poll, so that rich and poor
paid alike. A more inequitable and odious measure
could hardly have been devised. The statute,
however, with the dullness that usually characterizes
the work of legislative bodies, forgot to specify
the quality of tobacco in which the rates should be
paid. Naturally, therefore, they were paid in the
vilest unmarketable stuff that could be found, and
the Episcopal clergymen found it hard to keep the
wolf from the door. There was thus no
inducement for competent ministers to
come to Maryland, and those that were sent from
England were of the poorest sort which the English
Church in that period of its degradation could
provide. Dr. Thomas Chandler, of New Jersey,
who visited the eastern shore of Maryland in 1753,
wrote to the Bishop of London as follows: “The
general character of the clergy ... is wretchedly
bad.... It would really, my lord, make the
ears of a sober heathen tingle to hear the stories
that were told me by many serious persons of
several clergymen in the neighbourhood of the
parish where I visited; but I still hope that some
abatement may be fairly made on account of the
prejudices of those who related them.”<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> The
Swedish botanist, Peter Kalm, who visited Maryland
about the same time, tells us that it was a
common trick with a parson, when performing the
marriage service for a poor couple, to halt midway
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
and refuse to go on till a good round fee had been
handed over to him.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a> On such occasions it may

quality.</p>

<p>The last decade of the seventeenth century was
a period of ceaseless wrangling over church matters.
Almost every year saw some new
act passed from which its opponents
succeeded in causing the assent of the
crown to be withheld. The government
of William III. was not ill-disposed toward a
policy of toleration, except toward Papists. Accordingly,
although the act of 1692 remained
substantially in force until the American Revolution,
it was so qualified in 1702 as to exempt
Quakers and other Protestant Dissenters from
civil disabilities, and to allow them the free exercise
of public worship in their own churches or
meeting-houses. They were not exempted, however,
from the poll tax for the maintenance of the
Episcopal church.</p>

vexed. In the autumn of 1704 two priests were
summoned before the council: the one, William
Hunter, was accused of consecrating a chapel,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
which he answered with a plea that was in part
denial and in part “confession and
avoidance;” the other, Robert Brooke,
acknowledged the truth of the charge that
he had said mass at the chapel of St. Mary’s. The
request of these gentlemen for legal counsel was
refused. As the complaint against them was a first
complaint, they were let off with a reprimand,
which the newly installed governor, John Seymour,
thus politely administered: “It is the unhappy
temper of you and all your tribe to grow insolent
upon civility and never know how to use it, and yet
of all people you have the least reason for considering
that, if the necessary laws that are made
were let loose, they are sufficient to crush you, and
which (if your arrogant principles have not
blinded you) you must need to dread. You might,
methinks, be content to live quietly as you may,
and let the exercise of your superstitious vanities
be confined to yourselves, without proclaiming
them at public times and in public places, unless
you expect by your gaudy shows and serpentine
policy to amuse the multitude and beguile the
unthinking, ... an act of deceit well known to
be amongst you. But, gentlemen, be not deceived....
In plain and few words, if you intend to live
here, let me hear no more of these things; for if
I do, and they are made good against you, be
assured I’ll chastise you.... I’ll remove the evil
by sending you where you may be dealt with as
you deserve.... Pray take notice that I am an
English Protestant gentleman, and can never
equivocate.” After this fulmination the governor
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
ordered the sheriff of St. Mary’s county to lock
up the Catholic chapel and “keep the key
thereof;” and for all these proceedings the House
of Burgesses declared themselves “cheerfully
thankful” to his excellency, whom they found
“so generously bent to protect her majesty’s Protestant
subjects here against insolence and growth
of Popery.”<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a></p>

<div id="Cruel_laws_against_Catholics" class="sidenote">Cruel laws
against
Catholics.</div>

<p>From 1704 to 1718 several ferocious acts were
passed against Catholics. A reward of £100 was
offered to any informer who should “apprehend
and take” a priest and convict
him of saying mass, or performing any
of a priest’s duties; and the penalty for the priest
so convicted was perpetual imprisonment. Any
Catholic found guilty of keeping a school, or
taking youth to educate, was to spend the rest of
his life in prison. Any person sending his child
abroad to be educated as a Catholic was to be
fined £100. No Catholic could become a purchaser
of real estate. Certain impossible test
oaths were to be administered to every Papist
youth within six months after his attaining majority,
and if he should refuse to take them he was
to be declared incapable of inheriting land, and
his nearest kin of Protestant faith could supplant
him. The children of a Protestant father might
be forcibly taken away from their widowed mother
and placed in charge of Protestant guardians.
When extra taxes were levied for emergencies,
Catholics were assessed at double rates.<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a></p>

<div id="Crown_requisitions" class="sidenote">Crown

<p>These atrocities of the statute book were a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
symptom of the inflammatory effect wrought upon
the English mind by the gigantic war against
Louis XIV., and immediately afterward by the
wild attempt of the so-called James III. to seize
the crown of Great Britain. From the accession
of William and Mary to the end of the reign of
Anne, war against France was perpetual except
for the breathing spell after the Peace of Ryswick.
This state of things brought a fresh burden upon
Maryland. War between France and Great Britain
meant war between the Algonquin
tribes and the English colonies aided by
the Five Nations. The new situation was heralded
in the Congress which met at New York in 1690,
at Leisler’s invitation, when Maryland was called
upon to contribute men and money toward the
invasion of Canada. With the advent of the
royal government came royal requisitions for military
purposes; and although this new burden was
due to the new continental situation rather than to
the change in the provincial government, it was
one thing the more to make Marylanders look
back with regret to the days of the proprietary
rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Revival of
the palatinate,
1715.</div>

<p>For four-and-twenty years after 1691 the third
Lord Baltimore lived in England in the full
enjoyment of his private rights and revenues,
though deprived of his government. His
son, Benedict Leonard Calvert, was a
prince who took secular views of public
policy, like the great Henry of Navarre. He preferred
his palatinate to his church, and abjured
the Catholic faith, much to the wrath and disgust
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
of his aged father, who at once withdrew his
annual allowance of £450. Benedict was obliged
to apply to the crown for a pension, which was
granted by Anne and continued by George I.
until on February 20, 1715, the situation was completely
changed by the father’s death. On the
petition of Benedict, fourth Lord Baltimore, the
proprietary government of Maryland was
revived in his behalf. But Benedict survived
his father only six weeks, and on
April 5 his son Charles Calvert became fifth Lord
Baltimore. As Charles was a lad of sixteen, whose
Romanist faith had been forsworn with his father’s,
he was forthwith proclaimed Lord Proprietor of
Maryland, and royal governors no more vexed
that colony.</p>

<div id="Change_in_the_political_situation" class="sidenote">Change in
the political
situation.</div>

<p>Despite all troubles it had thriven under their
administration. The population had doubled within
less than twenty years, and on Charles’s accession
it was reckoned at 40,700 whites and 9,500
negroes.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Oppressive statutes had not prevented
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
the Catholics from increasing in numbers and the
influence which ability and character always wield.
They were preëminently the picked men of the
colony. Entire suppression of their forms of
worship had been recognized as impracticable. An
act of 1704 had allowed priests to perform religious
services in Roman Catholic families, though
not in public. From this permission advantage
was taken to build chapels as part of private
mansions, so that the family with their guests
might worship God after their manner, relying
upon the principle that an Englishman’s
house is his castle. By some of these
people it was hoped that the restoration
of the palatinate would revive their political rights
and privileges. But this renewal of the palatinate
was far from restoring the old state of things.
The position of the fifth Lord Baltimore was very
different from that of the second and third. They
were Catholic princes, and were steadily supported
by two Catholic kings of England. The new
proprietor was a Protestant, dependent upon the
favour of a Protestant king. The features of the
old palatinate government, therefore, which lend
the chief interest to its history, were never restored.
Catholic citizens remained disfranchised,
and continued to be taxed for the support of a
church which they disapproved.</p>

<div id="Charles_Carroll" class="sidenote">Charles

<p>An interesting project was entertained about
this time, by Charles Carroll and other
Catholic gentlemen, of leading a migration
to the Mississippi valley, thus transferring
their allegiance from Great Britain to France.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
Mr. Carroll, a descendant of the famous Irish sept
of O’Carrolls, and one of the foremost citizens of
Maryland, had long been agent and receiver of
rents for the third Lord Baltimore. The scheme
which he was now contemplating might have led
to curious results, but it was soon abandoned. A
grant of territory by the Arkansas River was
sought from the French government,<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a> but it proved
impossible to agree upon terms, and that region
remained a wilderness until several questions of
world-wide importance had been settled.</p>

<div id="Seeds_of_revolution" class="sidenote">Seeds of
revolution.</div>

<p>Though the accession of the fifth Lord Baltimore
did not reinstate the Catholics in their civil
rights, it nevertheless did much to mitigate the
operation of the oppressive statutes against them.
An early symptom of Charles’s temper was shown
by his reappointment of Carroll as his agent. He
went on to do such justice to Catholics as was in
his power, and under his mild and equitable rule
the fierceness of political passion was much abated.
The proprietary government retained its popularity
until it came to an end with the Declaration
of Independence. But the interval of crown government
from 1691 to 1715 had for the first time
made the connection with Great Britain
seem oppressive, and had planted the
seeds of future sympathy with the revolutionary
party in Massachusetts and Virginia. As the long
struggle with France increased in dimensions, the
political questions at issue in the several colonies
became more and more continental in character.
All were more or less assimilated one to another,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
and thus the way toward federation was prepared.
Thus the discussions in Maryland came more and
more to deal with the rights of the colonial legislature
and British interference with them. At the
same time Maryland had a grievance of her own
in the poll tax for maintaining a foreign and hated
church. In 1772 an assault upon that tax was the
occasion of one of the most remarkable legal controversies
in American annals; and the leader in
that assault, Charles Carroll’s grandson and namesake,
Charles Carroll of Carrollton, soon afterward
signed his name to the Declaration of Independence.</p>

<div id="End_of_the_palatinate" class="sidenote">End of the
palatinate.</div>

<p>In 1751, after a tranquil reign, only two years
of which were spent in Maryland, Charles Calvert
died in London, and was succeeded by his son
Frederick, sixth and last Lord Baltimore.
After a series of Antonines, at
last came the Commodus. Frederick was a miserable
debauchee, unworthy scion of a noble race.
For Maryland he cared nothing except to spend
its revenues in riotous living in London. One
adventure of his, for which he was tried and
acquitted on a mere technicality, fills one of the
most loathsome chapters of the Newgate Calendar.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a>
But this villain was represented in Maryland by
two excellent governors, Horatio Sharpe from
1753 to 1768, and then Sir Robert Eden, who had
married Frederick’s younger sister. Eden remained
in authority until June 24, 1776, when he
embarked for England with the good wishes of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
people. The wretched Frederick died in 1771,
without legitimate children, and the barony of
Baltimore became extinct. By the will of Charles,
the fifth baron, the proprietorship of Maryland
was now vested in Frederick’s elder sister, Louisa,
wife of John Browning. But Frederick had also
left a will, in which he devised the province to an
illegitimate son, called Henry Harford. This
young man laid claim to the proprietorship, but
before the chancery suit was ended the Palatinate
of Maryland had become one of the thirteen
United States.

<div id="Tobacco_and_liberty" class="sidenote">Tobacco and
liberty.</div>

<p>A learned son of Old Virginia, who is fond of
wrapping up a bookful of meaning in a single
pithy sentence, has declared that “a true history
of tobacco would be the history of English and
American liberty.” This remark occurs near the
beginning of Mr. Moncure Conway’s dainty volume
printed for the Grolier Club, entitled “Barons
of the Potomack and the Rappahannock.” When
construed liberally, as all such sweeping statements
need to be, it contains a kernel of truth. It was
tobacco that planted an English nation
in Virginia, and made a corporation in
London so rich and powerful as to become a formidable
seminary of sedition: it was the desire to
monopolize the tobacco trade that induced Charles
I. to recognize the House of Burgesses; discontent
with the Navigation Act and its effect upon
the tobacco trade was potent among the causes of
Bacon’s Rebellion; and so on down to the eve of
Independence, when Patrick Henry won his first
triumph in the famous Parson’s Cause, in which
the price of tobacco furnished the bone of contention,
the Indian weed has been strangely implicated
with the history of political freedom.</p>

<p>Furthermore, when we reflect upon the splendid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
part played by Virginia in winning American independence
and bringing into existence the political
framework of our Federal Republic; when we
recollect that of the five founders of this nation
who were foremost in constructive work&mdash;Washington,
Hamilton, Madison, Jefferson, and Marshall&mdash;four
were Virginians,&mdash;it becomes interesting
to go back and study the social features of the community
in which such leaders of men were produced.
The economic basis of that community
was the cultivation of tobacco on large plantations,
and from that single economic circumstance resulted
most of the social features which we have
now to pass in review.</p>

<div id="Rapid_growth_of_tobacco_culture" class="sidenote">Rapid
growth of
tobacco
culture.</div>

<div id="Attempts_to_check_it" class="sidenote">Attempts to
check it.</div>

<p>We have seen in a previous chapter how important
was the cultivation of tobacco in setting the
infant colony at Jamestown upon its feet in 1614
and the following years. In the rapid development
of the colony during the reign of Charles I.
other kinds of agriculture thrived, there were good
crops of wheat, and Indian corn was exported.
But tobacco culture increased rapidly
and steadily until in the latter part of
the century it nearly extinguished all
other kinds of activity, except the raising of
domestic animals and vegetables needed for food.
Long before this result was reached, the tendency
was deplored by the colonists themselves. To use
a modern political phrase, it was “viewed with
alarm.” This is quite intelligible. “We know
now that tobacco, though not strictly a necessary
of life, is one of those articles whose consumption
may be looked on as certain and permanent. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
the seventeenth century, men could hardly be
blamed if they regarded the use of tobacco as a
precarious fashion.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a> It was also felt that in case
of war it would be dangerous for Virginia to be
forced to rely upon importing the manufactured
necessaries of life. Moreover, the absorption of
the colony’s industry in the production of a single
staple made it especially easy for the home government
to depress that industry by stupid legislation,
as in the reign of Charles II., when the
Navigation Act so seriously diminished the purchasing
power of tobacco. For these various
reasons many attempts were made to
check the cultivation of the Indian weed.
The legislation of the seventeenth century was full
of instances. It was attempted to establish rival
industries and to produce silk, cotton, and iron;
laws were made forbidding any planter to raise
more than 2,000 plants in one year’s crop, and so
on. All such attempts proved futile; in spite of
everything that could be done, tobacco drove all
competitors from the field.</p>

cheap
labour.</div>

<div id="Indentured_white_servants" class="sidenote">Indented
white
servants.</div>

<p>This tobacco was generally cultivated upon
large estates. The policy of making extensive
grants of land as an inducement to settlers was
begun at an early date, and all that was needed to
develop the system was an abundance of
cheap labour. English yeomanry, such
as came to New England, was too intelligent
and enterprising to furnish the right sort.
English yeomanry, coming to Virginia, came to
own estates for itself, not to work them for others.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
It soon became necessary to have recourse to servile
labour. We have seen negro slaves first
brought into the colony from Africa in 1619, but
their numbers increased very slowly, and it was only
toward the end of the century that they began to
be numerous. In the early period the demand for
servile labour was supplied from other sources.
Convicted criminals were sent over in great numbers
from the mother country, as in later times
they were sent to Botany Bay. On their arrival
they were indented as servants for a term
of years. Kidnapping was also at that
time in England an extensive and lucrative
business. Young boys and girls, usually but
not always of the lowest class of society, were
seized by press-gangs on the streets of London and
Bristol and other English seaports, hurried on
board ship, and carried over to Virginia to work
on the plantations or as house servants. These
poor wretches were not, indeed, sold into hopeless
slavery, but they passed into a state of servitude
which might be prolonged indefinitely by avaricious
or cruel masters. The period of their indenture
was short,&mdash;usually not more than four years;
but the ordinary penalty for serious offences,
such as were very likely to be committed, was a
lengthening of the time during which they were
to serve. Among such offences the most serious
were insubordination or attempts to escape, while
of a more venial character were thievery, or unchaste
conduct,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> or attempts to make money on
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
their own account. Their lives were in theory protected
by law, but where an indented servant came
to his death from prolonged ill-usage, or from excessive
punishment, or even from sudden violence,
it was not easy to get a verdict against the master.
In those days of frequent flogging, the lash was
inflicted upon the indented servant with scarcely
less compunction than upon the purchased slave;
and in general the condition of the former seems
to have been nearly as miserable as that of the
latter, save that the servitude of the negro was perpetual,
while that of the white man was pretty sure
to come to an end. For him, Pandora’s box had
not quite spilled out the last of its contents.</p>

<div id="Notion_that_Virginians_are_descended_from_convicts" class="sidenote">Notion that
Virginians
are descended
from
convicts.</div>

<p>In England the notion presently grew up that
the aristocracy of Virginia was recruited from
the ranks of these kidnapped paupers
and convicts. This impression may have
originated in statements, based upon real
but misconstrued facts, such as we find
in Defoe’s widely read stories, “Moll Flanders”<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
and “Colonel Jack.” So, too, in Mrs. Aphra
Behn’s comedy, “The Widow Ranter, or, The History
of Bacon in Virginia,” one of the personages,
named Hazard, sails to Virginia, and on arriving
at Jamestown suddenly meets an old acquaintance,
named Friendly, whereupon the following conversation
ensues:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p><i>Hazard.</i> This unexpected happiness o’erjoys me.
Who could have imagined to have found thee in Virginia?...</p>

<p><i>Friendly.</i> My uncle dying here left me a considerable
plantation.... But prithee what chance (fortunate
to me) drove thee to this part of the New World?</p>

<p><i>Hazard.</i> Why, ’faith, ill company and that common
vice of the town, gaming.... I had rather starve
abroad than live pitied and despised at home.</p>

<p><i>Friendly.</i> Would [the new governor] were landed;
we hear he is a noble gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Hazard.</i> He has all the qualities of a gallant man.
Besides, he is nobly born.</p>

<p><i>Friendly.</i> This country wants nothing but to be
peopled with a well-born race to make it one of the best
colonies in the world; but for want of a governor we
are ruled by a council, some of whom have been perhaps
transported criminals, who having acquired great
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
estates are now become Your Honour and Right Worshipful,
and possess all places of authority.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">Malachy
Postlethwayt.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Dr. Johnson.</div>

<p>It is not only in novels and plays, however, that
we encounter such statements. Malachy Postlethwayt,
author of several valuable and
scholarly treatises on commerce, tells us:
“Even your transported felons, sent to
Virginia instead of Tyburn, thousands of them,
if we are not misinformed, have, by turning their
hands to industry and improvement, and (which
is best of all) to honesty, become rich, substantial
planters and merchants, settled large families, and
been famous in the country; nay, we have seen
many of them made magistrates, officers of militia,
captains of good ships, and masters of good
estates.”<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Either from the study of Postlethwayt,
or perhaps simply from reading “Moll Flanders,”
we may suppose that Dr. Johnson got
the notion to which he gave vent in 1769
when quite out of patience because the ministry
seemed ready to make some concessions to the
Americans. “Why, they are a race of convicts,”
cried the irate doctor, “and ought to be thankful
for anything we allow them short of hanging!”<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span>
Thus we witness the progress of generalization:
first it is some Virginians that are jail-birds, or
offspring of jail-birds, then it is all Virginians,
finally it is all Americans. A few years ago, in
the time of our Civil War, one used to find this
grotesque notion still surviving in occasional polite
statements of European newspapers, informing
their readers that the citizens of the United States
are the “offspring of the vagabonds and felons of
Europe.”<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a></p>

<div id="Who_were_the_indentured_white_servants" class="sidenote">The real
question.</div>

<p>The statement of the worthy Postlethwayt seems
based partly on observation, partly on information,
and has unquestionably been the source
of inferences much more sweeping than
facts will sustain. In order to arrive at clear
views of the subject, we must distinguish between
two questions:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<p>1. What sort of people, on the whole, were the
indented white servants in Virginia?</p>

<p>2. How far did they ever succeed, as freedmen,
in attaining to high social position in the colony?</p>

<div id="Redemptioners" class="sidenote">Redemptioners.</div>

<p>In answering the first question, a mere reference
to “felons” and “convicts” will carry us
but little way. A considerable proportion of the
indented white servants were poor but honest persons
who sold themselves into slavery for a brief
term to defray the cost of the voyage from England.
The ship-owner received from the planter
the passage-money in the shape of tobacco, and
in exchange he handed over the passenger to be
the planter’s servant until the debt was wiped out.
Indented servants of this class were known as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
“redemptioners,” and many of them were eminently
industrious and of excellent character.
Such redemptioners came in large
numbers to Virginia, Maryland, and the middle
colonies, and much more rarely to New England,
where the demand for any kind of servile labour
was but small.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Punishments
for crime.</div>

<p>Again, among the transported convicts were
many who had been sentenced to death for what
would now be considered trivial offences; the poor
woman who stole a joint of meat to relieve her
starving children was not necessarily a hardened
criminal, yet if the price of the joint were more
than a shilling she incurred the death
penalty. For counterfeiting a lottery
ticket, or for personating the holder of a stock and
receiving the dividends due upon it, the punishment
was the same as for wilful murder.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a> The
favourite remedy prescribed in law was the gallows,
as in medicine the lancet. Yet many judges
and officers of state were conscious of the excessive
severity of the system, and welcomed the device
of sending the less hardened offenders out of the
kingdom instead of putting them to death. There
is reason for believing that murderers, burglars,
and highwaymen continued to be summarily sent
to Tyburn, while for offences of a lighter sort and
in cases with extenuating circumstances the death
penalty was often commuted to transportation. As
a rule it was not the worst sort of offenders who
were sent to the colonies.</p>

<div id="Distribution_of_convicts" class="sidenote">Number and
distribution
of convicts.</div>

<p>The practice of sending rogues beyond sea began
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
soon after the founding of Virginia, and continued
until it was cut short in America by the War of
Independence; thereafter the Australasian colonies
were made a receptacle for them until the practice
came to an end soon after the middle of the nineteenth
century. It has been estimated
that between 1717 and 1775 not less
than 10,000 “involuntary emigrants”
were sent from the Old Bailey alone;<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> and possibly
the total number sent to America from the
British islands in the seventeenth and eighteenth
centuries may have been as high as 50,000.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> In
the lists of such offenders their particular destinations
are apt to be very loosely and carelessly
indicated; the name Virginia, for example, is often
used so vaguely as to include the West Indies.<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a>
The destinations most commonly specified are Virginia,
Maryland, Barbadoes, and Jamaica, but it
is certain that all English colonies outside of New
England received considerable numbers of convicts.
Very few were brought to New England,
because the demand for such labour was less than
elsewhere, and therefore the prisoners would not
fetch so high a price.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> Stringent laws were made
against bringing in such people. In 1700 Massachusetts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
enacted that every master of a ship arriving
with passengers must hand to the custom-house
officer a written certificate of the “name, character,
and circumstances” of each passenger, under
penalty of a fine of £5 for every name omitted;
and the custom-house officer was obliged to deliver
to the town clerk the full list of names with the
accompanying certificates.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> The existence of this
wholesome statute indicates that undesirable persons
had been brought into the colony; and the
reënactment of it in 1722, with the fine raised
from £5 to £100, is clear proof that the nuisance
was not yet abated. Nevertheless, partly because
of such vigilant measures of prevention, but much
more because of the economic reason above alleged,
the four New England colonies received but few
convicts.</p>

<div id="Prisoners_of_war" class="sidenote">Prisoners of
war.</div>

<p>A very different class of transported persons
consisted of those who were not criminals at all,
but merely political offenders, or even prisoners of
war. For example, of the Scotch prisoners
taken at Dunbar in 1650, Cromwell
sent about 150 to Boston. The next year orders
were issued for sending 1,610 of the Worcester
captives to Virginia, but very few of them seem
to have arrived there.<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> In 1652 a party of 272
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
men captured at Worcester were landed in Boston,
but so small was the demand for their labour that
they were soon exported southward,&mdash;perhaps to
the West Indies in exchange for sugar or rum.
After the restoration of the monarchy so many
non-conformists were sold into servitude in Virginia
as to lead to an insurrection in 1663, followed
by legislation designed to keep all convicts
out of the colony.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> On the whole, the number of
political offenders brought to those colonies that
have since become the United States was certainly
much smaller than the number of criminal convicts,
while the latter were in all probability much
less numerous than the redemptioners. During
the seventeenth century the demand for wholesale
servile white labour was much greater in Virginia
and Maryland than elsewhere, and there are many
indications that they received more convicts and
redemptioners than the other colonies. In the
eighteenth century, however, the middle colonies,
especially Pennsylvania, probably received at least
as large a share.</p>

<p>Our survey shows that in the class of indented
white servants there was a wide range of gradation,
from thrifty redemptioners<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a> and gallant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
rebels at the one extreme down to ruffians and
pickpockets at the other. Bearing this
in mind, we come to our second question,
How far did white freedmen succeed in
attaining to high social position in such a colony
as Virginia? There is no doubt that, as Postlethwayt
declares, some of the best of them did
work their way up to the ownership of plantations.
In the seventeenth century they were occasionally
elected to the House of Burgesses. The composition
of that assembly for 1654 affords an interesting
example. One of the two members for
Warwick was the worthy Samuel Mathews, soon
to be elected governor; and one of the four members
for Charles City was Major Abraham Wood,
who, as a child of ten years, had been brought
from England in 1620, and had been a servant of
Mathews. John Trussel, the member for Northumberland,
and William Worlidge, one of the
two members for Elizabeth City, had been servants
brought over in 1622, aged respectively
nineteen and eighteen.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> Whether these lads had
been offenders against the law does not appear,
nor do we know whether the child had come with
parents not mentioned, or as the victim of kidnappers.
We only know that all three were servants,<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
and, if the word is to be understood in the ordinary
sense, it was much to their credit that they
rose to be burgesses. Cases of ordinary indented
servants thus rising were certainly exceptional in
the seventeenth century, and still more so in the
eighteenth. Nothing can be more certain
than that the representative families of
Virginia were not descended from convicts,
or from indented servants of any
sort. Although family records were
until of late less carefully preserved than in New
England, yet the registered facts abundantly prove
that the leading families had precisely the same
sort of origin as the leading families in New England.
For the most part they were either country
squires, or prosperous yeomen, or craftsmen from
the numerous urban guilds; and alike in Virginia
and in New England there was a similar proportion
of persons connected with English families
ennobled or otherwise eminent for public service.</p>

<div id="Some_of_the_freedmen_became_small_proprietors" class="sidenote">Some white
freedmen
became
small proprietors.</div>

<p>As for the white freedmen, those of the better
sort often acquired small estates, while some became
overseers of white servants and black slaves.
The kind of life which they led is described
in Defoe’s “Colonel Jack” with
that great writer’s customary minuteness
of information. The class of small proprietors
always remained in Virginia, and included
many other persons beside freedmen. With the
increasing tendency toward the predominance of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
great estates in tidewater Virginia, there was a
tendency for the smaller proprietors to move westward
into the Piedmont region or southward into
North Carolina, as will appear in the next chapter.</p>

<div id="Some_became_mean_whites" class="sidenote">Some became
“mean
whites.”</div>

<p>While it was true that “the convicts ...
sometimes prove very worthy creatures and entirely
forsake their former follies,”<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> it was also
true that many of them “have been and are the
poorest, idlest, and worst of mankind, the refuse
of Great Britain and Ireland, and the outcast of
the people.”<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> These degraded freedmen
were apt to be irreclaimable vagabonds.
According to Bishop Meade, they gave
the vestrymen a great deal of trouble. “The
number of illegitimate children born of them and
thrown upon the parish led to much action on the
part of the vestries and the legislature. The lower
order of persons in Virginia in a great measure
sprang from those apprenticed servants and from
poor exiled culprits. It is not wonderful that
there should have been much debasement of character
among the poorest population, and that the
negroes of the first families should always have
considered themselves a more respectable class.
To this day [1857] there are many who look upon
poor white folks (for so they call them) as much
beneath themselves; and, in truth, they are so in
many respects.”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> Indeed, the fact that manual
labour was a badge of servitude, while the white
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
freedmen of degraded type were by nature and experience
unfitted to perform any work of a higher
sort, was of itself enough to keep them from doing
any work at all, unless driven by impending starvation.
As manual labour came to be more and
more entirely relegated to men of black and brown
skins, this wretched position of the mean whites
grew worse and worse. The negro slave might
take a certain sort of pride in belonging to the
grand establishment of a powerful or wealthy master,
and from this point of view society might be
said to have a place for him, even though he possessed
no legal rights. There was no such haven of
security for the mean whites. If the negro was like
a Sudra, they were simply Pariahs. Crimes against
person and property were usually committed by
persons of this class. They were loungers in taverns
and at horse-races, earning a precarious livelihood,
or violent death by gambling and thieving;
or else they withdrew from the haunts of civilization
to lead half-savage lives in the backwoods.
In these people we may recognize a strain of the
English race which has not yet on American soil
become extinct or absorbed. There can be little
doubt that the white freedmen of degraded type
were the progenitors of a considerable portion of
what is often called the “white trash” of the
South. Originating in Virginia and Maryland,
the greater part of it seems to have been gradually
sifted out by migration to wilder regions westward
and southward, much to the relief of those colonies.
As to the probable manner of its distribution,
something will be said in the next chapter.

<div id="Anti_slavery_sentiment_in_Virginia" class="sidenote">Anti-slavery
sentiment in
Virginia.</div>

<p>Long before the end of the seventeenth century,
Virginia and Maryland had begun to protest
against the policy of sending criminals from England,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a>
and as negro slaves became more numerous
white servitude was greatly diminished. The rapid
increase of negroes began toward the end of the
century, and an immense impetus was
given it by the <i>asiento</i> clause of the
treaty of Utrecht in 1713. By way of
indemnifying herself for the cost of the
War of the Spanish Succession, victorious England
bade Spain and France keep their hands off
from Africa, while she monopolized for herself the
slave-trade. We are reminded by Mr. Lecky that
this was the one clause in the treaty that seemed
to give the most general satisfaction; and while an
eminent prelate affixed his name to the treaty and
a magnificent <i>Te Deum</i> by Handel was sung in the
churches, it occurred to nobody to denounce as unchristian
a national scheme for kidnapping thousands
of black men and selling them into slavery.<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a>
Before 1713 the part which English ships had
taken in the slave-trade was comparatively small;
and it is curious now to look back and think how
Marlborough and Eugene at Blenheim were unconsciously
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
cutting out work for Grant and Sherman
at Vicksburg. In 1700 there were probably
60,000 Englishmen and 6,000 negroes in Virginia;
by 1750 there were probably 250,000 whites and
250,000 blacks, while during that same half century
the peopling of the Carolinas was rapidly
going on.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> This portentous increase of the slave
population presently began to awaken serious alarm
in Virginia. Attempts were made to restrict the
importation of negroes, and at the time of the
Revolutionary War the humanitarian spirit of the
eighteenth century showed itself in the rise of a
party in favour of emancipation. In 1784 Thomas
Jefferson announced the principle upon which
Abraham Lincoln was elected to the presidency
in 1860, the prohibition of slavery in the national
domain; Jefferson attempted to embody this principle
in an ordinance for establishing
territorial government west of the Alleghanies.
In 1787 George Mason denounced
the “infernal traffic” in flesh and blood
with phrases quite like those which his grandchildren
were to resent when they fell from the
lips of Wendell Phillips. The life of the anti-slavery
party in Virginia was short. After the
abolition of the African slave-trade in 1808 had
increased the demand for Virginia-bred slaves in
the states farther south, the very idea of emancipation
faded out of memory.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span></p>

<div id="Theory_that_negroes_were_non_human" class="sidenote">Theory that
negroes
were non-human.</div>

<p>I have already remarked upon the approval with
which negro slavery was by many people regarded
in the days of Queen Elizabeth. To bring black
heathen within the pale of Christian civilization
was deemed a meritorious business.<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a> But there
were people who took a lower and coarser view
of the matter. They denied that the negro was
strictly human; it was therefore useless
to try to make him a Christian, but it was
right to make him a beast of burden, like
asses and oxen.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a> This point of view was illustrated
in the remark made by a lady of Barbadoes,
noted for her exemplary piety, to Godwyn, the able
author of “The Negro’s and Indian’s Advocate;”
she told him that “he might as well baptize puppies
as negroes.”<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a> This line of thought was pursued
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
to all sorts of grotesque conclusions. Some
held that mulattoes were made half human by the
infusion of white blood, and might accordingly be
baptized. Others deemed it poor economy to baptize
the slave, since it would be incumbent on the
master to feed Christians better than heathen, and
so flog them less. And there were yet others who
had heard the doctrine that Christians ought not
to be held in bondage, and feared lest baptism
should be judged equivalent to emancipation.<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a>
This notion was at first so prevalent in Virginia
that in 1667 it was enacted: <span id="Baptizing_a_slave_did_not_work_his_emancipation">“Whereas some</span>
doubts have risen whether children that are slaves
by birth, and by the charity and piety of their
owners made partakers of the blessed sacrament
of baptisme, should by vertue of their baptisme be
made ffree; It is enacted and declared by this
grand assembly and the authority thereof, that the
conferringe of baptisme doth not alter the condition
of the person as to his bondage or ffreedom; that
diverse masters, ffreed from this doubt, may more
carefully endeavour the propagation of christianity
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span>
by permitting children, though, slaves, or those of
greater growth if capable, to be admitted to that
sacrament.”<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<div id="Negroes_as_real_estate" class="sidenote">Negroes as
real estate.</div>

<p>During the seventeenth century the slave was
regarded as personal property, but a curious statute
of 1705 declared him to be for most purposes
a kind of real estate. He could be
sold, however, without the registry of a deed; he
could be recovered by an action of trover; and he
was not reckoned a part of the property qualification
which entitled his master to the political privileges
of a freeholder.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a></p>

<div id="Tax_on_slaves" class="sidenote">Taxes on
slaves.</div>

<p>In the system of taxation white servants and
negro slaves played an important part. The primary
tax upon all landholders was the
quit-rent of a shilling for every fifty
acres, payable at Michaelmas. This quit-rent was
at first collected in the name of the Company, but
after 1624 in the King’s name; and the proceeds
were devoted to various public uses. It was always
an unpopular tax, inasmuch as there was no feasible
way (as now-a-days with our blessed tariffs)
of making dullards believe that “the foreigner
paid it,” and there were frequent complaints of
delinquency. Another tax was the duty of two
shillings upon every hogshead of tobacco exported.
A third was the tax upon slaves and servants. At
the close of the seventeenth century adult negroes
were valued at from £25 to £40, and children at
£10 or £12; there seems to have been little if
any difference between the prices of men and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
women.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> The taxation of slave property was equitable,
inasmuch as it bore most heavily upon those
best able to pay.</p>

<div id="Treatment_of_slaves" class="sidenote">Treatment
of slaves.</div>

<p>It is generally admitted that the treatment of
slaves by their masters was mild and humane.
There were instances of cruelty, of course. Cruelty
forever lurks as a hideous possibility in the mildest
system of slavery; it is part of its innermost
essence. In every community there
are brutes unfit to have the custody of their fellow-creatures.
Such a ruffian was the Rev. Samuel
Gray, who had his runaway black boy tied to a
tree and flogged to death. Separation of families
also occurred, though much less frequently than
in later times. But cases of cruelty were on the
whole rare. The cultivation of tobacco was not
such a drain upon human life as the cultivation
of sugar in the West Indies, or the raising of
indigo and rice in South Carolina. It created
a kind of patriarchal society in which the master
felt a genuine interest in the welfare of his slaves.
“The solicitude exhibited by John Page of York
was not uncommon: in his will he instructed his
heirs to provide for the old age of all the negroes
who descended to them from him, with as much
care in point of food, clothing, and other necessaries
as if they were still capable of the most profitable
labour.”<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> The historian, Robert Beverley,
writing in 1705, tells us that “the male servants
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
and the slaves of both sexes are employed together
in tilling and manuring the ground, in sowing and
planting corn, tobacco, etc. Some distinction indeed
is made between them in their clothes and
food; but the work of both is no other than what
the overseers, the freemen, and the planters themselves
do.... And I can assure you with a great
deal of truth that generally their slaves are not
worked near so hard, nor so many hours in a day,
as the husbandmen and day-labourers in England.”
As for cruelty, he exclaims, with honest
fervour, “no people more abhor the thoughts of
such usage than the Virginians, nor take more
precaution to prevent it.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a></p>

<div id="Fears_of_insurrection" class="sidenote">Fears of insurrection.</div>

<div id="Cruel_laws" class="sidenote">Cruel laws.</div>

<p>Nevertheless, a state of enforced servitude is
something which human nature does not willingly
endure. A slave-holding community must provide
for catching runaways and suppressing or preventing
insurrections. It is one of the remarkable
facts in American history that there have been so
few insurrections of negroes. There have been,
however, occasional instances and symptoms which
have kept slave-owners in dread and
given rise to harsh legislation. In 1687
a conspiracy among the blacks on the Northern
Neck was detected just in time to prevent the explosion.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a>
In 1710 a similar plot in Surry County
was betrayed by one of the conspirators, whom the
assembly proceeded to reward by giving him his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
freedom with permission to remain in the colony.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a>
The fears engendered by such discoveries are
revealed in the statute book. Slaves were not
allowed to be absent from their plantations without
a ticket-of-leave signed by their master. The
negro who could not show such a passport must
receive twenty lashes, and was liable to be treated
as a fugitive or “outlying” slave. Such runaways
were formally outlawed; a proclamation issued by
two justices of the peace was read on the next
Sunday by the parish clerk from the door
of every church in the county, after which
anybody might seize the fugitive and bring him
home, or kill him if he made any resistance. In
the latter event the master was indemnified from
the public funds. At the discretion of the county
court, such mutilation might be inflicted upon the
outlying negro as to protect white women against
the horrible crime which then as now he was prone
to commit.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> In 1701 we find an act of the assembly
directed against “one negro man named Billy,” who
“has severall years unlawfully absented himselfe
from his masters services, lying out and lurking in
obscure places, ... devouring and destroying stocks
and crops, robing the houses of and committing
and threatening other injuryes to severall of his
majestye’s good and leige people.” It was enacted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
that whosoever should bring in the said Billy alive
or dead should receive a thousand pounds of tobacco
in reward, and if dead, his master’s loss
should be repaired with four thousand pounds.
Anybody who should aid or harbour Billy was to
be adjudged guilty of felony.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a> No penalty was
attached to the murder of a slave by his master;
but if he were killed by any one else, the master
could recover his value, just as in case of damage
done to a dog or a horse. Slaves were not allowed
to have fire-arms or other weapons in their possession;
“and whereas many negroes, under pretence
of practising physic, have prepared and exhibited
poisonous medicines, by which many persons have
been murdered, and others have languished under
long and tedious indispositions, and it will be difficult
to detect such pernicious and dangerous practices
if they should be permitted to exhibit any
sort of medicine,” it was enacted that any slave
who should prepare or administer any medicine
whatsoever, save with the full knowledge and consent
of the master or mistress, should suffer death.<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>
The testimony of a slave could not be received in
court except when one of his own race was on trial
for life; then, if he should be found to testify
falsely, he was to stand for an hour with one ear
nailed to the pillory, and then be released by
slicing off the ear; the same process was then
repeated with the other ear, after which the ceremony
was finished at the whipping-post with nine-and-thirty
lashes on the bare back, “well laid
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
on.”<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a> Stealing a slave from a plantation was a
capital offence.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a> No master was allowed to emancipate
one of his slaves, except for meritorious
services, in which case he must obtain a license
from the governor and council. If a slave were
set free without such a license, the church-wardens
could forthwith arrest him and sell him at auction,
appropriating the proceeds for the parish funds,
and thereby lightening the taxes.<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> When a license
was granted, the master received the usual indemnity,
and by an act of 1699 the freedman was
required to quit the colony within six months;<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a>
for obviously the presence of a large number of
free blacks in the same community with their
enslaved brethren was a source of danger. They
were apt, moreover, to become receivers of stolen
goods, and their shiftless habits made them paupers.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a>
Nevertheless there were some free negroes
in the colony, and at one time they even appear to
have had the privilege of voting, for an act of 1723
deprived them of it; but no free negroes, whether
men or women, were exempt from taxation.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<div id="Taking_slaves_to_England" class="sidenote">Taking
slaves to
England.</div>

<div id="Lord_Mansfields_decision" class="sidenote">Lord Mansfield’s
decision.</div>

<p>Since gentlemen from the North American colonies
and from the West Indies not unfrequently
visited England, and sometimes remained there
for months or years, it was quite natural that they
should take with them household slaves to whose
personal attendance they were accustomed. In
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
course of time the question thus arose whether
the arrival of a slave upon the free soil
of England worked his emancipation.
According to Virginia law it did not.<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a>
The opinion expressed in 1729 by Lord Talbot,
the attorney-general, and supported by Lord Hardwicke,
agreed with the Virginia theory. These
eminent lawyers held that mere arrival in England
was not enough to free a slave without some specific
act of emancipation, but Chief Justice Holt
expressed a contrary opinion. Meanwhile masters
kept carrying negroes to London until in 1764 the
“Gentleman’s Magazine” asserted (surely with
wild exaggeration) that no less than 20,000 were
domiciled there. Escape was so easy for them
that their owners felt obliged to put collars on
them, duly inscribed with name and address. In
1685 the “London Gazette” advertised Colonel
Kirke’s runaway black boy, upon whose silver collar
the colonel’s arms and cipher were engraved;
in 1728 the “Daily Journal” informs us that a
stray negro has on his collar the inscription, “My
Lady Bromfield’s black in Lincoln’s Inn Fields;”
and in the “London Advertiser,” 1756, a goldsmith
in Westminster announces that he makes “silver
padlocks for Blacks’ or Dogs’ collars.” Colonel
Kirke and Lady Bromfield were not American visitors,
but residents in London, and there is evidence,
not abundant but sufficient, that negroes were now
and then bought and sold there for household service.
When the forger John Rice was hanged at
Tyburn in 1763, his effects were sold at auction,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
and a black boy brought £32. A similar sale
at Richmond in 1771 was mentioned in terms
of severe condemnation by the “Stamford Mercury.”<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a>
However the English people may have
sanctioned the establishment of slavery beyond
sea, they were not disposed to tolerate it at home;
and in the sixty years withal since the treaty of
Utrecht, the public conscience had grown tender
on the subject. The days of Clarkson and Wilberforce
were at hand. A cry was raised
by the press, a test case was brought
before the King’s Bench, and in 1772
Lord Mansfield pronounced the immortal decision
that “as soon as a slave sets foot on the soil of the
British islands he becomes free.”</p>

<div id="Jeffersons_opinion_of_slavery" class="sidenote">Jefferson on
slavery.</div>

<p>It is not long after this that we find Thomas
Jefferson&mdash;himself the kindest of masters, and
familiar with slavery in its mild Virginia form&mdash;thus
writing about it: “The whole commerce
between master and slave is a perpetual
exercise of the most boisterous passions, the
most unremitting despotism on the one part, and
degrading submissions on the other. Our children
see this, and learn to imitate it.... The man
must be a prodigy who can retain his manners and
morals undepraved by such circumstances....
With the morals of the people their industry also
is destroyed. For in a warm climate no man will
labour for himself who can make another labour
for him. This is so true that of the proprietors
of slaves a very small proportion, indeed, are ever
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
seen to labour. And can the liberties of the nation
be thought secure when we have removed
their only firm basis, a conviction in the minds of
the people that these liberties are of the gift of
God? that they are not to be violated but with
his wrath? Indeed, I tremble for my country
when I reflect that God is just.”<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a></p>

<div id="Sexual_immoralities" class="sidenote">Sexual immoralities.</div>

<p>In no respect was the system of slavery more
reprehensible than in the illicit sexual
relations that grew out of it. The extent
of the evil may be realized when we simply
reflect that the numerous race of mulattoes and
quadroons did not originate from wedlock. In
1691 it was enacted that any white man or woman,
whether bond or free, intermarrying with a negro,
mulatto, or Indian, should be banished for life.
In 1705 the penalty was changed to fine and imprisonment,
and for any minister who should dare
to perform the ceremony there was prescribed a
fine nearly equal to his whole year’s salary.<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Yet
the “abominable mixture and spurious issue,”
against which these statutes were aimed, went on,
unsanctioned by law and unblessed by the church.
Usually mulattoes were the children of negresses
by white fathers, but it was not always so. Some
of the wretched women from English jails seem to
have had fancies as unaccountable as those of the
frail sultanas of the Arabian Nights. In such cases
the white mother, if free, was fined £15, or in default
thereof was sold into servitude for five years; if
she were a bondwoman, the church-wardens waited
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
for her term of service to expire, and then sold
her for five years; her child was bound to service
until thirty years of age.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a> The case of the bastards
of negresses was very simply disposed of by
enacting that the legal status of children was the
same as that of their mother.<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a> This made them
all slaves, from the prognathous and platyrrhine
creature with woolly hair to the handsome and
stately octoroon, and secured their labour to the
master. At first the illicit relations between masters
and their female slaves were frowned at, and
in some instances visited with church discipline or
punished by fines.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> But public opinion seems to
have lost its sensitiveness in the presence of a
custom which lasted until slavery was abolished.<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>
With the signal advance in refinement which the
nineteenth century ushered in, there is reason to
believe that in many a southern home there were
earnest hearts that deplored the dreadful evil, and
welcomed at last the downfall of the system that
sustained it.</p>

<div id="Classes_in_Virginia_society" class="sidenote">Classes in
Virginia
society.</div>

<p>Some writers divide Old Virginia society into
four classes,&mdash;the great planters, the
small planters, the white servants and
freedmen, and the negro slaves. The
division is sound, provided we remember that between
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
the two upper classes no hard and fast line
can be drawn. Already in England the classes of
rural gentry and yeomen shaded into one another;
in Virginia both alike became land-holders and
slave-owners, they mingled together in society,
and their families intermarried. A typical instance
is that of the parents of Thomas Jefferson.
His paternal ancestors were yeomanry who in
Virginia developed into country squires. The
first Jefferson in Virginia was a member of the
first House of Burgesses in 1619; Thomas’s father,
who was also a burgess and county lieutenant,
owned about thirty slaves. Thomas’s mother,
Jane Randolph, whose grandfather migrated to
Virginia in 1674, belonged to a family that had
been eminent in England since the thirteenth century,
including among its members a baron of the
exchequer, a number of knights, a foreign ambassador,
a head of one of the colleges at Oxford, etc.</p>

<div id="Huguenots_in_Virginia" class="sidenote">Huguenots
in tidewater
Virginia.</div>

<p>There can be no doubt that the white blood of
tidewater Virginia was English almost without
admixture until the end of the seventeenth
century, and of the very slight
admixture nearly all was from the British
islands. There was a desultory sprinkling
of Protestant Frenchmen, Walloons, and Dutch,
scarcely appreciable in the mass of the population.
But after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, in
1685, Virginia received a small part of the Huguenot
exodus from France. The largest company,
more than seven hundred in number, led by the
Breton nobleman, Olivier, Marquis de la Muce,
arrived in the year 1700, and settled in various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
places, more particularly at Monacan Town in
Henrico County. A part of this company were
Waldenses from Piedmont, who had taken refuge
in Switzerland, and thence made their way through
Alsace and the Low Countries to England.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> Other
parties came from time to time, adding to Virginia
many estimable citizens whom France could
ill afford to lose. Among the Huguenot names in
Virginia, the reader will recognize Maury, Flournoy,
Jouet, Moncure, Fontaine, Marye, Bertrand,
and others.<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> Dabneys (<i>D’Aubigné</i>) and Bowdoins
(<i>Baudouin</i>) came to Virginia as well as to
Boston. Such was the principal foreign admixture
while Virginia was still tidewater Virginia,
before the crossing of the Blue Ridge. The advent
of Germans and Scotch-Irish will be treated
in a future chapter.</p>

<p>Having thus considered the composition of society
in its different strata, as connected with
wholesale tobacco culture, let us observe one of
the most conspicuous results of this industry
as influenced by the physical geography of the
country. One might suppose that the necessity
for exporting the enormous crops of tobacco would
have called into existence a large class of thriving
merchants, who would naturally congregate at
points favourable for shipping, and thus give rise
to towns. In most countries that is what would
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span>
have happened. But the manner in which the
Virginia planter disposed of his crops was peculiar.
Most of the large plantations
lay on or near the wide and deep rivers
of that tidewater country;<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> and each
planter would have his own wharf, from which
his own slaves might load the tobacco on to the
vessels that were to carry it to England. If
the plantation lay at some distance from a navigable
river, the tobacco was conveyed to the nearest
creek and tied down upon a raft of canoes, and so
floated and paddled down stream until some head
of navigation was reached, where a warehouse was
ready to receive it. The vessels which carried
away this tobacco usually paid for it in all sorts
of manufactured articles that might be needed
upon the plantations. Every manufactured article
that required skill or nicety of workmanship was
brought from England, in ships of which the owners,
masters, and crews were for the most part
either natives of the British islands or of New
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
England. Such a ship would unload upon the
planter’s wharf some part of its motley cargo
of mahogany tables, chairs covered with russia
leather, wines in great variety from the Azores
and Madeira,<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a> brandy, Gloucester cheeses, linens
and cottons, silks and dimity, quilts and featherbeds,
carpets, shoes, axes and hoes, hammers
and nails, rope and canvas, painters’ white lead
and colours, saddles, demijohns, mirrors, books,&mdash;pretty
much everything.<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> If she came from a
New England port she was likely to bring salted
cod and mackerel, with fragrant rum,
either out of the distilleries at Newport
and Boston,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> or imported from Antigua
or Jamaica. Sometimes the rum came from Barbadoes,
along with sugar and molasses, and occasionally
ginger and lime-juice, in return for which
the ship often carried away some of the planter’s
live hogs or packed pork, as well as butter, and
corn, and tanned leather. The landing of rum
was sometimes private and confidential, for there
were duties on it which lent a charm to evasion.</p>

<div id="Some_domestic_industries" class="sidenote">Some
domestic
industries.</div>

<p>It would be too much to say that there was no
manufacturing done in colonial Virginia. There
were probably few if any plantations where the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
spinning-wheel and hand-loom were not busy.
Female slaves and white servants wove
coarse cloth and made it up into suits of
clothes<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> for people of their sort, and
doubtless for some of the small planters. Such
artisans as blacksmiths, carpenters, and coopers,
shipwrights, tailors, tanners, and shoemakers were
often to be found among the indentured servants.
Boys of this class were sometimes upon their arrival
made apprentices in these crafts. Occasionally
negro slaves became more or less skilled as workmen,
especially as coopers and joiners. There
must always have been some demand for the
labour of white freedmen acquainted with any of
the mechanical arts, and in fact instances of free
labourers in these departments are found. There
can be no doubt, however, that the style of work
thus attained was apt to be unsatisfactory; for we
find such planters as Colonel Byrd and Colonel
Fitzhugh, late in the seventeenth century, sending
to England for skilled workmen, and offering to
pay very high wages, on the ground that it was
wasting money to employ such workmen as were
to be had in the colony.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<div id="Beverley_complains_of_his_countrymen" class="sidenote">Beverley’s
complaint
against his
countrymen.</div>

<p>The historian Beverley, who sometimes indulged
himself (like the late Matthew Arnold) in upbraiding
his fellow-countrymen for their own good,
says of the Virginians in 1705: “They have their
Cloathing of all sorts from <i>England</i>, as Linnen,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Woollen, Silk, Hats, and Leather. Yet Flax and
Hemp grow no where in the World,
better than there; their Sheep yield a
mighty Increase, and bear good Fleeces,
but they shear them only to cool them. The Mulberry-Tree,
whose Leaf is the proper Food of the
Silk-worm, grows there like a Weed, and Silk-worms
have been observ’d to thrive extreamly, and
without any hazard. The very Furrs that their
Hats are made of, perhaps go first from thence;
and most of their Hides lie and rot, or are made
use of, only for covering dry Goods, in a leaky
House. Indeed some few Hides with much adoe
are tann’d, and made into Servants Shoes; but at
so careless a rate, that the Planters don’t care
to buy them, if they can get others; and sometimes
perhaps a better manager than ordinary,
will vouchsafe to make a pair of Breeches of a
Deer-Skin. Nay, they are such abominable Ill-husbands,
that tho’ their Country be over-run
with Wood, yet they have all their Wooden Ware
from <i>England</i>; their Cabinets, Chairs, Tables,
Stools, Chests, Boxes, Cart-wheels, and all other
things, even so much as their Bowls, and Birchen
Brooms, to the Eternal Reproach of their Laziness....
Thus they depend altogether upon the
Liberality of Nature, without endeavoring to improve
its Gifts, by Art or Industry. They spunge
upon the Blessings of a warm Sun, and a fruitful
Soil, and almost grutch the Pains of gathering in
the Bounties of the Earth. I should be asham’d
to publish this slothful Indolence of my Countrymen,
but that I hope it will rouse them out of their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
Lethargy, and excite them to make the most of all
those happy Advantages which Nature has given
them; and if it does this, I am sure they will have
the Goodness to forgive me.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">True state of
the case.</div>

<p>It was not, however, as Mr. Bruce reminds us,
from any “inherent repugnance” that Englishmen
in Virginia did not take kindly to manufactures,
and perhaps the good Beverley’s reproachful tone
is a trifle overdone. When the planter could get
sharp knives, well-made boots, and fine blankets
at his own wharf, simply by handing over to the
skipper a few hogsheads of tobacco, he
was not greatly to be blamed for preferring
them to such dull knives, clumsy boots, and
coarse blankets as could be made by the workmen
within reach. Many inconveniences, however,
grew out of the absence of local means for supplying
local needs, and I have little doubt that sundry
trades and crafts could have been made to flourish
much better than they did, had it not been for the
baneful effects of a tobacco currency, which we
shall presently have to consider.</p>

<div id="Absence_of_town_life" class="sidenote">Absence of
town life.</div>

<p>The most conspicuous result of the absorption
of all activities in tobacco-planting, and the absence
of developed arts and trades, was the non-existence
of town life. At the beginning
of the eighteenth century there was
hardly so much as a village in Virginia, unless we
make an exception in honour of Williamsburg, the
new seat of government and of the college. By
the middle of the century Williamsburg contained
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
about 200 houses, chiefly wooden, and its streets
were unpaved. Richmond, founded in 1737, had
a population of 3,761 in the census of 1790. The
growth of Norfolk, founded in 1705, was exceptional.
The trade with the West Indies, for
sugar, molasses, and rum, tended to become concentrated
there, and the proximity of North Carolina
made it a mart for lumber at a time when
Virginia forests in the lower tidewater region had
been largely cleared away. Colonel Byrd in 1728
says of the Norfolk people: “They have a pretty
deal of lumber from the borderers on the Dismal,
who make bold with the king’s land thereabouts,
without the least ceremony.” Besides boards and
shingles, they sent beef and pork to the West
Indies, and it was not unusual to see a score of
sloops and brigantines riding in the noble harbour.
Under these favourable circumstances the
population of Norfolk had come by 1776 to be
about 6,000. At that time Philadelphia had
some 35,000 inhabitants, and New York 25,000,
though the population of their two states taken
together scarcely equalled that of Virginia.</p>

<div id="Futile_attempts_to_make_towns_by_legislation" class="sidenote">Futile attempts
to
make towns
by legislation.</div>

<p>The lack of urban life was deplored by the
legislators at Jamestown and Williamsburg, and
assiduous efforts were made to correct the evil;
but neither bounties nor orders to build were of
avail. To make towns on paper was as
easy as to make a promissory note, but
nobody would go and settle in the towns.
Most of the county seats consisted simply
of the court-house, flanked by the jail, the dismal
country inn, and the nondescript country “store,”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span>
where the roving peddler sometimes replenished
his pack on his route through the plantations.
Among the legislative acts designed to encourage
the building of towns, three were especially important.
The act of 1662 ordered that thirty-two
brick houses should be erected at Jamestown, and
forbade the building or repairing of wooden houses
there; all tobacco grown in the three counties of
James City, Charles City, and Surry was to be
sent to Jamestown and stored there for shipping,
and the penalty for disobedience of this order was
a fine of 1,000 lbs. of tobacco; every ship, moreover,
ascending the river above Mulberry Island,
must land its cargo at Jamestown and nowhere
else, under penalty of forfeiting the cargo. Half
of these fines was to be paid to the town, the other
half to the informer.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> The statute of 1680, commonly
known as the Cohabitation Act, undertook
in somewhat similar fashion to establish a town in
every county; and the attempt was renewed on a
larger scale in 1691.<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> But all these acts were
either disregarded or suspended. When the Surry
planter could effect an exchange at his own wharf,
without incidental expense or risk, it was useless
to command him to load his crop on shallops and
send it to Jamestown, with a charge for freight, a
chance of capsizing, and warehouse dues at the
end of the journey. The skipper withal had no
wish to be saddled with port dues, or to be hindered
from stopping and trading wherever a customer
hove in sight. So skipper and planter had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
their way, and towns refused to grow.<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> When
Thomas Jefferson entered William and Mary College
in 1760, a lad of seventeen years, he had
never seen so many as a dozen houses grouped
together.</p>

<div id="The_country_store" class="sidenote">The country
store.</div>

<p>The country store was an important institution
in Old Virginia. Under some conditions it would
have formed a nucleus around which a
town would have been developed, but in
Virginia the store seems to have been regarded as
a kind of rival against which the town could not
compete.<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a> It furnished a number of petty centres
which did away with the need for larger centres.
The store was apt to be an appendage to a plantation,
unless its size became such as to reverse the
relationship, after the manner of Dundreary’s dog.
It might be a room in a planter’s house, or it
might be a detached barn like building on the
estate. Mr. Bruce tells us that to enumerate its
contents would be to mention pretty much every
article for which Virginians had any use. For
example, the inventory of the Hubbard store in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
York County, taken in 1667, “contained lockram,
canvas, dowlas, Scotch cloth, blue linen, oznaburg,
cotton, holland, serge, kersey, and flannel in bales,
full suits for adults and youths, bodices, bonnets,
and laces for women, shoes, ... gloves, hose,
cloaks, cravats, handkerchiefs, hats, and other
articles of dress, ... hammers, hatchets, chisels,
augers, locks, staples, nails, sickles, bellows, froes,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a>
saws, axes, files, bed-cords, dishes, knives, flesh-forks,
porringers, sauce-pans, frying-pans, gridirons,
tongs, shovels, hoes, iron posts, tables,
physic, wool-cards, gimlets, compasses, needles,
stirrups, looking-glasses, candlesticks, candles,
funnels, 25 pounds of raisins, 100 gallons of
brandy, 20 gallons of wine, and 10 gallons of aqua
vitæ. The contents of the Hubbard store were
valued at £614 sterling, a sum which represented
about $15,000 in our present currency.”<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> One
can imagine how dazzling to youthful eyes must
have been the miscellaneous variety of desirable
things. Not only were the manufactured articles
pretty sure to have come from England, but everything
else, to be salable, must be labelled English,
“insomuch that fanciers used to sell the songsters
unknown to England, if they sang particularly
well, as <i>English mocking-birds</i>.”<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a></p>

<div id="Rivers_and_roads" class="sidenote">Roads</div>

<p>We have seen how the rivers and creeks were
used as highways of traffic; for a long time they
were the only highways, and the sloop or the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
canoe was the only kind of vehicle, public or private,
in which it was possible to get about with
ease and safety.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> Until after the middle of the
eighteenth century there were but few roads save
bridle-paths, and such as there were became
impassable in rainy weather. There
were also but few bridges, and these were very
likely to be unsound, while the ferry-boats were apt
to be leaky. It was often necessary for the traveller
to swim across the stream, with a fair chance
of getting drowned, and more than a fair chance
of losing his horse. The course of the bridle-path
often became so obscure that it was necessary to
blaze the trees. It was not uncommon for people to
lose their way and find themselves obliged to stay
overnight in the woods, perhaps with the howls of
the wolf and panther sounding in their ears. The
highway robber was even a more uncomfortable customer
to meet than such beasts of prey; and in
those days, when banking was in its infancy and
travellers used to carry gold coins sewed under the
lining of their waistcoats, the highwayman enjoyed
opportunities which in this age of railways and
check-books are denied him. Nevertheless crime
was far less common than in England or France,
and travelling was much safer than one might suppose.
This was true of the whole colonial period.
In 1777 a young Rhode Island merchant, Elkanah
Watson, armed with a sabre and pair of pistols,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
journeyed from Providence to Charleston in South
Carolina, with several hundred pounds sterling in
gold quilted into his coat. In seventy days he
accomplished the distance of 1,243 miles, partly
on horseback and partly in a sulky, without encountering
any more serious mishaps than being
arrested for a British spy in Pennsylvania, and
meeting a large bear in North Carolina; and he
has left us a narrative of his journey, which is as
full of instruction as of interest.<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a></p>

<div id="Tobacco_as_currency" class="sidenote">Tobacco as
currency.</div>

<p>The traveller in Old Virginia, however, was not
likely to carry large sums of money concealed on
his person, for he dealt in a circulating medium
too bulky for that. In the course of this book we
have had frequent occasions to observe that the
Virginian’s current money was tobacco.
The prices of all articles of merchandise
were quoted in pounds of tobacco. In tobacco
taxes were assessed and all wages and salaries
were paid. This use of tobacco as a circulating
medium and as a standard of values was begun in
the earliest days of the colony, when coin was
scarce, and the structure of society was simple
enough to permit a temporary return toward the
primitive practice of barter. Under such circumstances
tobacco was obviously the article most
sure to be used as money. It was exchangeable
for whatever anybody wanted in the shape of service
or merchandise, and it was easily procured
from the bountiful earth. But as time went on
this ease of attainment made it an extremely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
vicious currency. In the course of our narrative
we have encountered some of the disastrous financial
and social results that flowed from the use of
so cheap a substitute for money. Many reasons
have been alleged for the scarcity of coin throughout
the whole colonial period in Virginia;<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> but
assuredly the chief reason was the fact that tobacco
was currency. The bad money drove away
the good money, as it always does. There are
indications that there was always a small stock
of coin in the colony, but it was hoarded or sent to
other colonies or to England in the settlement of
trade balances. Yet it was not easy to demonetize
tobacco without a radical revolution in the industrial
system and in the commercial relations of the
colony.</p>

<div id="Effect_upon_crafts_and_trades" class="sidenote">Effect upon
crafts and
trades.</div>

<p>The nature of the currency evidently had much
to do with the ill success of the attempts to encourage
manufactures. The carpenter or
shoemaker, after doing his work, must
wait for his pay until the year’s crop of
tobacco was gathered and cured. Meanwhile he
had nothing to live on unless he raised it for
himself; he might either plant grain and rear
cattle, or else grow tobacco wherewith to buy
things. But the time consumed in these agricultural
operations was time taken from his handicraft.
The evil was attacked by legislation. “In
1633 brickmakers, carpenters, joiners, sawyers,
and turners were expressly forbidden to take part
in any form of tillage.” In 1662 tradesmen and
artisans were exempted from all taxes except
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
church-rates, on condition that they should abstain
from all interest, direct or indirect, in the growing
of tobacco. But the evil was not cured.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<div id="Effect_upon_planters_accounts" class="sidenote">Effect upon
planters’ accounts.</div>

<p>Further disaster came from the fact that tobacco
was a highly speculative crop. The fluctuations in
its value were liable to be great and sudden,
and they affected the price of every
article that was bought and sold throughout
the colony. No one could estimate from one
year to another, with any approach to accuracy,
what the purchasing power of his income was going
to be. The inevitable results of this were extravagance
in living and chronic debt. The planter
was drawn into a situation from which it was
almost impossible to extricate himself. “The
system of keeping open accounts in London was
calculated to encourage extravagance; and these
accounts were habitually overdrawn. Many of
the merchants even made it a rule to encourage
this indebtedness, so as to assure the continuance
of their customers. It gave them a certain advantage
in all their dealings with the planters.”<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a>
They charged nearly twice as much for their goods
sent to Norfolk or Williamsburg as for the same
goods sent to New York.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a> In all this they were
aided by the Navigation Act.</p>

<div id="Universal_hospitality" class="sidenote">Hospitality.</div>

<p>Extravagance in living was further stimulated
by the regal hospitality for which the great planters
early became famous. Although the life upon
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
their estates was much more busy than some writers
seem to suppose, yet the drudgery of
business did not consume all their time;
and in their rural isolation, with none of the diversions
of town life, the entertainment of guests by
the month together was regarded both as a duty
and as a privilege; and the example set by the
large plantations was followed by the smaller.
Even the keeper of an inn, if he wished to make a
charge for food and shelter, must notify the guest
upon his arrival, for a statute of 1663 declared that
in the absence of such preliminary understanding
not a penny could be recovered from the guest, however
long he might have staid in the house.<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> As a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
rule, no person whose company was at all desirable
was allowed to stop at an inn, for the neighbours
vied with one another in offering hospitality.
Every planter kept open house, and provided for
his visitors with unstinted hand.</p>

<div id="Visit_to_a_plantation_the_negro_quarter" class="sidenote">Visit to a
plantation;
the negro
quarter.</div>

<p>Let us put ourselves into the position of one of
these visitors, and get some glimpses of life upon
the old plantation. Our host we may
suppose to be a vestryman, justice of the
peace, and burgess, dwelling upon a
plantation of five or six thousand acres, with his
next neighbours at a distance of two or three
miles.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> The space is in great part cleared for the
planting of vast fields of tobacco, but here and
there are extensive stretches of woodland and
coppice, with noble forest trees and luxuriant
undergrowth, much rougher and wilder than an
English park. The cabins for slaves present
the appearance of a hamlet. These are wooden
structures of the humblest sort, built of logs or
undressed planks, and afflicted with chronic dilapidation.
An inventory of 1697 shows us that the
cabin might contain a bed and a few chairs, two
or three pots and kettles, “a pair of pot-racks, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
pot-hook, a frying-pan, and a beer barrel;” and
advertisements for runaways describe Cuffy and
Pompey as clad in red cotton, with canvas drawers,
waistcoat, and wide-brimmed black hat. Their
victuals, of “hog and hominy” with potatoes and
green vegetables, were wholesome and palatable.
If there were white servants on the estate, they
were commonly but not necessarily somewhat
better housed and clothed.</p>

<div id="Other_appurtenances" class="sidenote">Other appurtenances.</div>

<div id="The_Great_House" class="sidenote">The Great House.</div>

<p>Leaving the negro quarters, with their grinning
mammies and swarms of woolly pickaninnies, one
would presently come upon other outbuildings;
the ample barns for tobacco
and granaries for corn, the stable, the cattle-pens,
a hen-coop and a dove-cot, a dairy, and in some
cases a malt-house, or perhaps, as we have seen, a
country store. There were brick ovens for curing
hams and bacon; and the kitchen likewise stood
apart from the mansion, which was thus free from
kitchen odours and from undue heating in summer
time. There was a vegetable garden, with
“all the culinary plants that grow in England, and
in far greater perfection,” besides “roots, herbs,
vine-fruits, and salad-flowers peculiar to themselves,”
and excellent for a relish with meat.<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>
Nearer to the house, among redolent flower-beds
gay with varied colours, some vine-clad arbour
afforded shelter from the sun. A short walk
across the mown space shaded by large trees,
called, as in New England, the yard, would bring
us to the mansion, very commonly known as the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
Great House. From this epithet no sure inference
can be drawn as to the size of the building,
for it simply served to contrast it
with its dependent cabins and outhouses. It was
often called the Home House. It was apt to
stand upon a rising ground, and from its porch
you might look down at the blue river and the
little wharf, known as “the landing,” with pinnaces
moored hard by and canoes lying lazily on
the bank or suddenly darting out upon the water.
Turning away from the river, the eye would rest
upon an orchard bearing fruits in great variety,
and a pasture devoted to horses of some special
breed.</p>

<div id="Brick_and_wooden_houses" class="sidenote">Brick and wooden houses.</div>

<p>The planter’s mansion might be built of wood
or brick, but was comparatively seldom of stone.
In tidewater Virginia, good stone for
building purposes was not readily found,
but there was an abundance of red clay
from which excellent and durable brick could be
made. A number of brick houses were built in
the seventeenth century, but wood was much more
commonly used, since the work of clearing away
the forests furnished great quantities of timber of
the finest quality. Among the many articles that
were imported from England, bricks are not to be
reckoned.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a> Brickmaking went on from the earliest
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
days of the colony, and much of this work was
done by white servants and freedmen. In course
of time there came to be many brick houses, and
chimneys were regularly of this material. For
roofs the strong and durable cypress shingle was
the material most commonly used. Partition walls,
covered first with a tenacious clay and then white-washed,
were very firm and solid. The glass windows,
for protection against storms of a violence
to which Englishmen had not been accustomed,
had stout wooden shutters outside, which gave the
house somewhat the look of a stronghold.</p>

<div id="House_architecture" class="sidenote">House architecture.</div>

<p>During the seventeenth century not much architectural
beauty was attained. To any criticisms
on this score the planters would have replied, as
the early settlers did to Captain Butler, that their
houses were for use and not for ornament.<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> During
the eighteenth century some progress was
made in this respect, but for the architectural
effect of the mansions not much is
to be said, though they were often highly picturesque.
The earliest type, the house of greater
width than depth, with an outside chimney at each
end, is familiar to every one, at least in pictures.
It was as characteristic of Old Virginia as the
house of huge central chimney and small entryway
with transverse staircase was characteristic
of early New England. Both are slightly modified
types of the smaller English manor houses of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
the Tudor period. A more picturesque style, and
somewhat more stately, is that of Gunston Hall,
the homestead of the Mason family; while scarcely
less attractive, and still more capacious, is that of
Stratford Hall, the home of the Lees. The well-known
Mount Vernon shows a further departure
from English models; while in Monticello both
the name and the house present symptoms of the
beginning of that so-called classical revival when
children were baptized Cyrus and Marcellus, and
dwelt in the shade of porticoes that simulated
those of Greek temples.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a></p>

<div id="The_rooms" class="sidenote">The rooms.</div>

<div id="Bedrooms_and_their_furniture" class="sidenote">Bedrooms and their furniture.</div>

<p>The differentiation of rooms for specific uses
had by no means proceeded so far as in modern
houses. One mediæval English feature
which was retained was the predominance
of the Hall, or Great Room, used for meals
and for general purposes. Along with the hall,
there might be as few as five or six rooms, or as
many as eighteen or twenty, upstairs and down.
Stratford Hall, built about 1725-30, contained
eighteen large rooms, exclusive of the central hall,<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a>
whereas Governor Berkeley’s house at Green
Spring, built three quarters of a century earlier,
had but six rooms altogether. Beside the central
hall, there might be a hall parlour, equivalent to
reception room and family sitting-room combined,
and in this there might be chests and a bed; the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
others were simply bedrooms. Beds were such as
we are still familiar with; their ticking
might be stuffed with feathers or hair or
straw, but leathers were much more commonly
used than now, as they are now more commonly
used in chilly England than in the fiery
summers and hot-house winters of America. With
sheets, blankets, and counterpane, pillows, curtains,
and valances, the bed was dressed as at
present, save that curtains are now departing
along with the brass warming-pans, bequests from
higher latitudes. Already the Virginia bed often
had a protection for which England could have no
use, the mosquito net. For such members of the
household as were lazily inclined in the daytime
there was a couch, which might be plainly covered
with calico, or more expensively with russia leather
or embroidered stuffs. The chairs might be upholstered
likewise, or be seated with cane, wicker,
or rushwork. In every bedroom was a chest for
storing clothes not in immediate use. There were
also the ewer and basin, and the case of drawers
with looking-glass. If one of the big chimneys
was accessible, there was a fireplace for wooden
logs, supported on andirons of iron or brass, and
guarded by iron or tin fenders; otherwise there
was an open brazier, such as we see to-day in
Italy. Floors were usually ill-made in those days,
and woollen carpets faithfully accumulated dirt;
so that the sunbeam straggling through the dimity
or printed calico window-curtains would often gild
long dusty rays.</p>

<div id="The_dinner_table" class="sidenote">The dinner-table.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Napkins and forks.</div>

<div id="Silver_plate" class="sidenote">Silver plate.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Wainscots
and tapestry.</div>

<p>In the Hall, or Great Room, the principal feature
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
was the long dining-table of walnut or oak or
cedar, flanked either by benches or by chairs. For
daily use it was covered with a cloth
of unbleached linen, known as holland,
while on extra occasions a damask cloth was
used. Napkins were abundant, and often of a
fine fabric delicately embroidered. Forks, on the
other hand, were in the earlier days scarce. Before
the seventeenth century, forks were nowhere
in general use, save in Italy. Queen Elizabeth
ate with her fingers. A satirical pamphlet, aimed
at certain luxurious favourites of Henry III. of
France, derides them for conveying bits of meat to
their mouths on a little pronged implement,
rather than do it in the natural
way.<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> Forks are nowhere mentioned in Shakespeare.
In 1608, while travelling in Italy, one
Thomas Coryat took a liking to them and introduced
the fashion into England, for which he
was jocosely nicknamed <i>Furcifer</i>.<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a> Naturally the
use of forks narrowed the functions of napkins.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a>
Spoons were in much more common use, and, in
the New World as in the Old, were of iron or
pewter in the poor man’s house, and of silver in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
the rich man’s. The dishes and plates were of
earthenware or pewter, but in the eighteenth century
the use of chinaware increased. Pewter cups
and mugs were everywhere to be seen, and now
and then a drinking-horn. Well-to-do planters
had silver tankards, sometimes marked
with the family arms, as well as silver
salt-cellars, candlesticks, and snuffers. A cupboard
with glass doors, or light drapery, displayed the
store of cups and dishes; while about the walls
sometimes hung family portraits, and more rarely
paintings of other sorts. This central hall retained
many marks of its mediæval miscellaneousness
of use; capacious linen-chests, guns and
pistols, powder-horns, swords, saddles, bridles, and
riding-whips, in picturesque and cosy confusion.
In the eighteenth century a luxurious elegance was
developed quite similar to that of the “colonial
mansions” at the North, such as the Philipse
manor house on the Hudson River, or Colonel
Vassall’s house in Cambridge, where Washington
dwelt for a few months, and Longfellow for many
years. Panelled wainscots of oak and carved oaken
chimney-pieces were common; the walls
were hung with tapestry; and artistic
cabinets, screens, and clocks adorned the
spacious room. In the Lee homestead at Stratford
the hall added to its other functions that of
library. The ceiling was very high and vaulted,
and parts of the panelled walls had bookshelves
set into them.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> Such rooms were warmed by huge
logs of hickory or oak, burning in open fireplaces.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
They were lighted by candles, which might be
made of beef tallow or deer suet, but the favourite
material was a wax obtained by boiling the berries
of a myrtle that grew profusely in marshy land.
It was extremely cheap and burned with a pleasant
fragrance, giving a brilliant light.</p>

<div id="The_kitchen" class="sidenote">The kitchen.</div>

<p>The central object in the kitchen was, of course,
the fireplace, which was sometimes very large.
At Stratford it was “twelve feet wide,
six high, and five deep, evidently capable
of roasting a fair-sized ox.”<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a> In the days when
pains were taken not to spoil good meat with bad
cooking, your haunch of venison, saddle of mutton,
or stuffed turkey was not baked to insipidity in
an oven meant for better uses, but was carefully
turned about on an iron spit, catching rich aroma
from the caressing flame, while the basting was
judiciously poured from ladles, and dripping-pans
caught the savoury juices. Then there was the
great copper boiler imbedded in brick and heated
from underneath; there were the kettles and sauce-pans,
the swinging iron pot, the gridirons and frying-pans,
and the wooden trays for carrying the
cooked dishes to the dining-hall.</p>

<div id="Abundance_of_food" class="sidenote">Abundance of food.</div>

<p>The settlers in the strange wilderness of the
Powhatans had once had their Starving Time, but
it would be hard to point to any part of
the earth more bountifully supplied with
wholesome and delicious food than civilized Old
Virginia. Venison, beef, and dairy products were
excellent and cheap. Mutton was less common,
and was highly prized. The pork in its various
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
forms was pronounced equal to that of Yorkshire
or Westphalia. Succulent vegetables and toothsome
fruits were grown in bewildering variety.
Good Henry of Navarre’s peasant, had he lived in
this favoured country, might have had every day
a fowl in his pot; while, as for game and fish, the
fame of Chesapeake Bay is world-wide for its canvas-backs,
mallards, and red-heads, its terrapin, its
soles, bass, and shad, and, last not least, its oysters.
The various cakes which the cooks of the Old
Dominion could make from their maize and other
grains have also won celebrity.</p>

<div id="Beverages_native_and_imported" class="sidenote">Beverages, native and imported.</div>

<p>To wash down these native viands the Virginian
had divers drinks, whereof all the best were imported.
Englishmen could not in a moment leave
off beer-drinking, but the generous, full-bodied
and delicate-flavoured ale of the mother country
has never been successfully imitated on
this side of the Atlantic, and indeed
seems hardly adapted to our sweltering
summers. Concerning the beer brewed in Old
Virginia opinions varied; but since barley soon
ceased to be cultivated, and attempts were made
to supply its place with maize or pumpkins or persimmons,
we need not greatly regret that we were
not there to be regaled with it. Cider, with its
kindred beverages, was abundant,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> and doubtless
of much better quality. Apple-jack and peach
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
brandy were distilled. Other beverages were imported,
most commonly sack, of which Falstaff was
so fond; the name was applied to such dry (Spanish
<i>seco</i>) and strong wines as sherry and madeira.
In the cellars of wealthy planters were often found
choice brands of red wine from Bordeaux and white
wine from the Rhineland. Cognacs were also imported,
and of rum we have already spoken. Evidently
our friends, the planters, had sturdy tipplers
among them.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> Fortunately for them, the manufacture
of coarse whiskey from maize and rye had
not yet come into vogue, while of the less harmful
peaty “mountain dew” from Ireland or Scotland
we hear nothing.</p>

<div id="Smyths_picture_of_a_planter" class="sidenote">Smyth’s picture of a planter.</div>

<p>Of the daily life of a rich planter we have a
graphic account from John Ferdinand Smyth, a
British soldier who travelled through Virginia and
other colonies, and sojourned for some years in
Maryland, about the middle of the eighteenth century.
I cite the description, because so much has
been made of it: “The gentleman of fortune rises
about nine o’clock; he may perhaps make an excursion
to walk as far as his stable to see
his horses, which is seldom more than
fifty yards from his house; he returns to
breakfast between nine and ten, which is generally
tea or coffee, bread-and-butter, and very thin slices
of venison, ham, or hung beef. He then lies down
on a pallet on the floor, in the coolest room in the
house, in his shirt and trousers only, with a negro
at his head and another at his feet, to fan him
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
and keep off the flies; between twelve and one he
takes a draught of bombo, or toddy, a liquor composed
of water, sugar, rum, and nutmeg, which is
made weak and kept cool; he dines between two
and three, and at every table, whatever else there
may be, a ham and greens, or cabbage, is always a
standing dish. At dinner he drinks cider, toddy,
punch, port, claret, and madeira, which is generally
excellent here; having drank [<i>sic</i>] some few
glasses of wine after dinner, he returns to his pallet,
with his two blacks to fan him, and continues
to drink toddy, or sangaree, all the afternoon; he
does not always drink tea. Between nine and ten
in the evening he eats a light supper of milk and
fruit, or wine, sugar, and fruit, etc., and almost
immediately retires to bed for the night. This is
his general way of living in his family, when he
has no company. No doubt many differ from it,
some in one respect, some in another; but more
follow it than do not.”<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a></p>

<p>This extract seems to show that Rev. Samuel
Peters was not the only writer who liked to entertain
his trustful British friends with queer tales
about their American cousins.<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> No doubt Mr.
Smyth wrote it with his tongue in his cheek; but
if he meant what he said, we must remember that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
the besetting sin of travellers is hasty generalization.
We will take Mr. Smyth’s word for it that
one or more gentlemen were in the habit of passing
their days in the way he describes, and we may
freely admit that a good many gentlemen might
thus make shift to keep alive through some furious
attack of the weather fiend in August; but his
concluding statement, that this way of living was
customary, is not to be taken seriously. An extract
from the manuscript recollections of General
John Mason, son of the illustrious George Mason,
gives a different picture:<span class="nowrap">&mdash;</span></p>

<div id="The_mode_of_life_at_Gunston" class="sidenote">The mode of life at Gunston.</div>

<p>“It was very much the practice with gentlemen
of landed and slave estates ... so to organize
them as to have considerable resources within
themselves; to employ and pay but few tradesmen,
and to buy little or none of the coarse stuffs
and materials used by them.... Thus
my father had among his slaves carpenters,
coopers, sawyers, blacksmiths, tanners,
curriers, shoemakers, spinners, weavers, and
knitters, and even a distiller. His woods furnished
timber and plank for the carpenters and
coopers, and charcoal for the blacksmith; his cattle
killed for his own consumption and for sale
supplied skins for the tanners, curriers, and shoemakers;
and his sheep gave wool and his fields
produced cotton and flax for the weavers and spinners,
and his orchards fruit for the distiller. His
carpenters and sawyers built and kept in repair
all the dwelling-houses, barns, stables, ploughs,
harrows, gates, etc., on the plantations, and the
outhouses at the house. His coopers made the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span>
hogsheads the tobacco was prized in, and the tight
casks to hold the cider and other liquors. The
tanners and curriers, with the proper vats, etc.,
tanned and dressed the skins as well for upper as
for lower leather to the full amount of the consumption
of the estate, and the shoemakers made
them into shoes for the negroes. A professed
shoemaker was hired for three or four months in
the year to come and make up the shoes for the
white part of the family. The blacksmiths did
all the ironwork required by the establishment,
as making and repairing ploughs, harrows, teeth,
chains, bolts, etc. The spinners, weavers, and
knitters made all the coarse cloths and stockings
used by the negroes, and some of finer texture
worn by the white family, nearly all worn by the
children of it. The distiller made every fall a
good deal of apple, peach, and persimmon brandy.
The art of distilling from grain was not then
among us, and but few public distilleries. All
these operations were carried on at the home
house, and their results distributed as occasion
required to the different plantations. Moreover,
all the beeves and hogs for consumption or sale
were driven up and slaughtered there at the proper
seasons, and whatever was to be preserved was
salted and packed away for after distribution.</p>

<p>“My father kept no steward or clerk about him.
He kept his own books and superintended, with
the assistance of a trusty slave or two, and occasionally
of some of his sons, all the operations at
or about the home house above described.... To
carry on these operations to the extent required, it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
will be seen that a considerable force was necessary,
besides the house servants, who for such a
household, a large family and entertaining a great
deal of company, must be numerous; and such a
force was constantly kept there, independently of
any of the plantations, and besides occasional drafts
from them of labour for particular occasions. As
I had during my youth constant intercourse with
all these people, I remember them all, and their
several employments as if it was yesterday.”<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a></p>

<p>Now when we consider that Colonel Mason had
some 500 persons on his estate, and was known to
have sent from his private wharf as many as 23,000
bushels of wheat in a single shipment, it is clear
that no gentleman who spent the day lolling on a
couch and sipping toddy could have superintended
the details of business which his son describes.
George Mason was, no doubt, a fair specimen of
his class, and their existence was clearly not an
idle one. With the public interests of parish,
county, and commonwealth to look after besides,
they surely earned the leisure hours that were
spent in social entertainments or in field sports.</p>

<div id="A_glimpse_of_Mount_Vernon" class="sidenote">A glimpse
of Mount
Vernon.</div>

<p>A glimpse of the life of a planter’s wife, which
Bishop Meade declares to be typical, is given in a
letter from Mrs. Edward Carrington to her sister,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
about 1798. Colonel Carrington and his wife
were visiting at Mount Vernon. After
telling how Washington and the Colonel
sat up together until midnight, absorbed
in reminiscences of bivouac and hard-fought field,
she comes to Mrs. Washington, who alluded to
her days of public pomp and fashion as “her lost
days.” Then Mrs. Carrington continues: “Let
us repair to the old lady’s [Mrs. Washington’s]
room, which is precisely in the style of our good
old aunt’s,&mdash;that is to say, nicely fixed for all
sorts of work. On one side sits the chambermaid,
with her knitting; on the other, a little coloured
pet, learning to sew. An old, decent woman is
there, with her table and shears, cutting out the
negroes’ winter clothes, while the good old lady
directs them all, incessantly knitting herself. She
points out to me several pairs of nice coloured
stockings and gloves she had just finished, and
presents me with a pair half done, which she begs
I will finish and wear for her sake.” At this
domestic picture Bishop Meade exclaims: “If
the wife of General Washington, having her own
and his wealth at command, should thus choose to
live, how much more the wives and mothers of
Virginia with moderate fortunes and numerous
children! How often have I seen, added to the
above-mentioned scenes of the chamber, the instruction
of several sons and daughters going on,
the churn, the reel, and other domestic operations
all in progress at the same time, and the mistress,
too, lying on a sick-bed!”<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a>

<div id="Dress_of_planters_and_their_wives" class="sidenote">Dress of
planters and
their wives.</div>

<p>Although Mrs. Carrington may have finished
and worn the pair of knit gloves, yet most articles
of dress for well-to-do men and women were imported.
London fashions were strictly followed.
In the time of Bacon’s rebellion, your
host would have appeared, perhaps, in a
coat and breeches of olive plush or dark
red broadcloth, with embroidered waistcoat, shirt
of blue holland, long silk stockings, silver buttons
and shoe-buckles, lace ruffles about neck and
wrists, and his head encumbered with a flowing
wig; while the lady of the house might have worn
a crimson satin bodice trimmed with point lace, a
black tabby<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a> petticoat and silk hose, with shoes of
fine leather gallooned; her lace headdress would
be secured with a gold bodkin, and she would be apt
to wear earrings, a pearl necklace, and finger-rings

<p>The ordinary chances for the ladies to exhibit
their garments of flowered tabby, and beaux their
new plush suits, were furnished by the Sunday
services at the parish church, and by the frequent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
gatherings of friends at home. Weddings, of
course, were high times, as everywhere
and always; and the gloom of funerals
was relieved by feasting the guests, who
were likely to have come long distances over
which they must return.<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> These journeys, like
the journeys to church and to the court-house,
might be made in boats; on land they were made
on horseback. Carriages were very rare in the
seventeenth century, but became much more common
before the Revolution. In their fondness for
horses the Virginians were true children of England.
In the stables of wealthy planters were to
be found specimens of the finest breeds, and the
interest in racing was universal. Common folk,
however, were not allowed to take part in
the sport, except as lookers-on. One of
the earliest references to horse-racing is an order
of the county court of York in 1674: “James
Bullocke, a Taylor, haveing made a race for his
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span>
mare to runn w’th a horse belonging to Mr. Mathew
Slader for twoe thousand pounds of tobacco and
caske, it being contrary to Law for a Labourer to
make a race, being a sport only for Gentlemen, is
fined for the same one hundred pounds of tobacco
and caske.”<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> Half a century later, Hugh Jones
tells us that the Virginians “are such lovers of
riding that almost every ordinary person keeps a
horse; and I have known some spend the morning
in ranging several miles in the woods to find and
catch their horses only to ride two or three miles
to church, to the court-house, or to a horse-race.”<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a>
After 1740 there was a systematic breeding from
imported English thoroughbreds.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> Thirty years
later, we are told that “there are races at Williamsburg
twice a year; that is, every spring and
fall, or autumn. Adjoining to the town is a very
excellent course for either two, three, or four mile
heats. Their purses are generally raised by subscription,
and are gained by the horse that wins
two four-mile heats out of three; they amount to
an hundred pounds each for the first day’s running,
and fifty pounds each every day after, the
races commonly continuing for a week. There
are also matches and sweepstakes very often for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
considerable sums. Besides ... there are races
established annually almost at every town and considerable
place in Virginia; and frequent matches
on which large sums of money depend.... Very
capital horses are started here, such as would
make no despicable figure at Newmarket; nor
is their speed, bottom, or blood inferior to their
appearance.... Indeed, nothing can be more
elegant and beautiful than the horses here, either
for the turf, the field, the road, or the coach; ...
but their carriage horses seldom are possessed of
that weight and power which distinguish those
of the same kind in England.”<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a></p>

<div id="Fox_hunting" class="sidenote">Fox-hunting.</div>

<div id="Gambling" class="sidenote">Gambling.</div>

<p>Since the Virginians were excellent horsemen, it
was but natural that they should enjoy hunting.
No sport was more dear than chasing the
fox. Washington’s extreme delight in
riding to the hounds is well known; he kept it
up until his sixty-third year, when a slight injury
to his back made such exercise uncomfortable.
Washington was a true Virginian in his love for
his dogs, to whom he gave such pretty names as
Mopsey, Truelove, Jupiter, Juno, Rover, Music,
Sweetlips, Countess, Lady, and Singer. Shooting
and fishing were favourite diversions with
Washington; when he was President of the United
States, the newspapers used to tell of his great
catches of blackfish and sea-bass.<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> In
these tastes his neighbours were like him.
Less wholesome sports were cock-fighting, and
gambling with cards. The passion for gambling
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
was far too strong among the Virginians. Laws
were enacted against it; gambling debts were not
recoverable; innkeepers who permitted any game
of cards or dice, except backgammon, were subject
to a heavy fine besides forfeiting their licenses.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a></p>

<div id="A_rural_entertainment" class="sidenote">A rural

<p>An interesting newspaper notice, in the year
1737, shows that some of the innocent open-air
sports of mediæval England still survived:
“We have advice from Hanover
County, that on St. Andrew’s Day
there are to be Horse Races and several other
Diversions, for the entertainment of the Gentlemen
and Ladies, at the Old Field, near Captain
John Bickerton’s, in that county (if permitted by
the Hon. Wm. Byrd, Esquire, Proprietor of said
land), the substance of which is as follows, viz.:
It is proposed that 20 Horses or Mares do run
round a three miles’ course for a prize of five
pounds.</p>

<p>“That a Hat of the value of 20s be cudgelled
for, and that after the first challenge made the
Drums are to beat every Quarter of an hour for
three challenges round the Ring, and none to play
with their Left hand.</p>

<p>“That a violin be played for by 20 Fiddlers;
no person to have the liberty of playing unless
he bring a fiddle with him. After the prize is
won they are all to play together, and each a different
tune, and to be treated by the company.</p>

<p>“That 12 Boys of 12 years of age do run 112
yards for a Hat of the cost of 12 shillings.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span></p>

<p>“That a Flag be flying on said Day 30 feet
high.</p>

<p>“That a handsome entertainment be provided
for the subscribers and their wives; and such of
them as are not so happy as to have wives may
treat any other lady.</p>

<p>“That Drums, Trumpets, Hautboys, &amp;c., be
provided to play at said entertainment.</p>

<p>“That after dinner the Royal Health, His Honour
the Governor’s, &amp;c., are to be drunk.</p>

<p>“That a Quire of ballads be sung for by a number
of Songsters, all of them to have liquor sufficient
to clear their Wind Pipes.</p>

<p>“That a pair of Silver Buckles be wrestled for
by a number of brisk young men.</p>

<p>“That a pair of handsome Shoes be danced for.</p>

<p>“That a pair of handsome silk Stockings of one
Pistole<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a> value be given to the handsomest young
country maid that appears in the Field. With
many other Whimsical and Comical Diversions
too numerous to mention.</p>

<p>“And as this mirth is designed to be purely
innocent and void of offence, all persons resorting
there are desired to behave themselves with decency
and sobriety; the subscribers being resolved
to discountenance all immorality with the utmost
rigour.”<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a></p>

<div id="Music" class="sidenote">Music.</div>

<p>The part played by violins in this quaint programme
reminds us that fiddling was an accomplishment
highly esteemed in the Old Dominion.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
As an accompaniment for dancing it was very
useful in the home parties on the plantations.
The philosophic Thomas Jefferson,
as a dead shot with the rifle, a skilful
horseman, and a clever violinist, was a typical
son of Virginia. As boys learned to play the
violin, and sometimes the violoncello, girls were
taught to play the virginal, which was an ancestral
form of the piano. Virginals, and afterward
harpsichords, were commonly to be found in the
houses of the gentry, and not unfrequently hautboys,
flutes, and recorders.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> The music most often
played with these instruments was probably some
form of dance or the setting of a popular ballad;
but what is called “classical music” was not unknown.
Among the effects of Cuthbert Ogle, a
musician at Williamsburg, who died in 1755, we
find Handel’s “Acis and Galatea” and “Apollo’s
Feast,” four books of instrumental scores of his
oratorios, and ten books of his songs; also a manuscript
score of Corelli’s sonatas, and concertos
by the English composers, William Felton and
Charles Avison, now wellnigh forgotten.<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span></p>

<div id="Other_recreations" class="sidenote">Other recreations.</div>

<p>After 1716 there was a theatre at Williamsburg,
and during the sessions of the assembly,
when planters with their families came
from far and wide, there was much
gayety. At other seasons the monotony of rural
life was varied by the recreations above described,
with an occasional picnic in the woods, or a grand
barbecue in honour of some English victory or the
accession of a new king.</p>

<div id="Some_interesting_libraries" class="sidenote">Wormeley’s
library.</div>

<p>Some time was found for reading. The inventories
of personal estates almost always include
books, in some instances few and of little worth,
in others numerous and valuable. The
library of Ralph Wormeley, of Rosegill,
contained about four hundred titles. Wormeley,
who had been educated at Oriel College, Oxford,
was president of the council, secretary of state,
and a trustee of William and Mary College; he
died in 1701. Among his books were Burnet’s
“History of the Reformation,” a folio history of
Spain, an ecclesiastical history in Latin, Camden’s
“Britannia,” Lord Bacon’s “History of Henry
VII.,” and his “Natural History,” histories of
Scotland, Ireland, France, the Netherlands, and the
West Indies, biographies of Richard III., Charles
I., and George Castriot, Plutarch’s Lives, Burnet’s
“Theory of the Earth,” Willis’s “Practice of
Physick,” Heylin’s “Cosmography,” “a chirurgical
old book,” “the Chyrurgans mate,” Galen’s
“Art of Physick,” treatises on gout, pancreatic
juice, pharmacy, scurvy, and many other medical
works, Coke’s Reports and his “Institutes,” collections
of Virginia and New England laws, a history
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
of tithes, “The Office of Justice of the Peace,” a
Latin treatise on maritime law, and many other
law books, Usher’s “Body of Divinity,” Hooker’s
“Ecclesiastical Polity,” Poole’s “Annotations to
the Bible,” “A Reply to the Jesuits,” Fuller’s
“Holy State” and his “Worthies,” a concordance
to the Bible, Jeremy Taylor’s “Holy Living and
Dying,” “The Whole Duty of Man,” a biography
of St. Augustine, Baxter’s “Confession of Faith,”
and many books of divinity, a liberal assortment
of dictionaries and grammars of English,
French, Spanish, Latin, and Greek, the essays
of Montaigne and other French books, Cæsar,
Virgil, Horace, Ovid, Thucydides, Josephus,
Quintus Curtius, Seneca, Terence, “Æsop’s
Fables,” “Don Quixote,” “Hudibras,” Quarles’s
poems, George Herbert’s poems, Howell’s “Familiar
Letters,” Waller’s poems, the plays of Sir
William Davenant, “ffifty Comodys &amp; tragedies
in folio,” “The Displaying of Supposed Witchcraft,”
“An Embersee from y<sup>e</sup> East India Comp<sup>a</sup>
to y<sup>e</sup> Grand Tartar,” “The Negro’s and Indian’s
Advocate,” “A Looking Glass for the Times,”
and so on.<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> Though not the library of a scholar,
it indicates that its owner was a thoughtful man
and fairly well informed.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Libraries of
Byrd and
Lee.</div>

<p>A more remarkable library was that of William
Byrd, of Westover. It contained 3,625
volumes, classified nearly as follows: History,
700; Classics, etc., 650; French,
550; Law, 350; Divinity, 300; Medicine, 200;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span>
Scientific, 225; Entertaining, etc., 650.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a> This
must have been one of the largest collections of
books made in the colonial period. That of the
second Richard Lee, who died in 1715, contained
about 300 titles, among which we notice many
more Greek and Latin writers than in Wormeley’s,
especially such names as Epictetus, Aristotle de
Anima, Diogenes Laertius, Lucian, Heliodorus,
Claudian, Arrian, and Orosius, besides such mediæval
authors as Albertus Magnus and Laurentius
Valla.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<div id="Schools_and_printing" class="sidenote">Schools and
printing.</div>

<p>Such libraries were of course exceptional. In
most planters’ houses you would probably have
found a few English classics, with perhaps “Don
Quixote” and “Gil Blas,” and an assortment of
books on divinity, manuals for magistrates, and
helps in farming. Virginia was not eminent as a
literary or bookish community. There was no newspaper
until the establishment of the “Virginia
Gazette” in 1736. As for schools, the Lords Commissioners
of Plantations sent over a
series of interrogatories to Sir William
Berkeley in 1671, and asked him, among other
things, what provision was made for public instruction.
His reply was characteristic: “I thank God
there are no free schools nor printing, and I hope
we shall not have these hundred years; for learning
has brought disobedience and heresy and sects into
the world, and printing has divulged them, and
libels against the best government. God keep us
from both!”<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a> Lord Culpeper seems to have been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
much of Berkeley’s way of thinking, for we read
that, “February 21, 1682, John Buckner [was]
called before the Lord Culpeper and his council for
printing the laws of 1680 without his excellency’s
license, and he and the printer [were] ordered to
enter into bond in £100 <i>not to print anything</i>
thereafter until his majesty’s pleasure should be
known.”<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> The pleasure of Charles II. was, that
nobody should use a printing-press in Virginia,
and so he instructed the next governor, Lord
Howard, in 1684.</p>

<div id="Private_free_schools" class="sidenote">Private free
schools.</div>

<div id="Academies_and_tutors" class="sidenote">Academies
and tutors.</div>

<p>The establishment of a system of schools such
as flourished in New England was prevented by
the absence of town life and the long distances between
plantations. When Berkeley said there
were no free schools in Virginia, he may have had
in mind the contrast with New England. No
such schools were founded in Virginia by the
assembly, but there were instances of
free schools founded by individuals; as,
for example, the Symms school in 1636, Captain
Moon’s school in 1655, Richard Russell’s in 1667,
Mr. King’s in 1669, the Eaton school some time
before 1689, and Edward Moseley’s in 1721.<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a>
Indeed, there was after 1646<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> a considerable
amount of compulsory primary education in Virginia,
much more than has been generally supposed,
since the records of it have been buried in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
parish vestry-books. In the eighteenth century we
find evidences that pains were taken to educate coloured
people.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> It was not unusual for the plantation
to have among its numerous outbuildings a
school conducted by some rustic dignitary of the
neighbourhood. In the “old field schools” little
more was taught than “the three Rs,” but these
humble institutions are not to be despised; for it
was in one of them, kept by “Hobby, the sexton,”
that George Washington learned to read, write,
and cipher. His father and his elder brother
Lawrence had been educated at Appleby
School, in England; George himself,
after an interval with a Mr. Williams, near Wakefield,
finished his school-days at an excellent academy
in Fredericksburg, of which Rev. James Marye
was master. The sons of George Mason studied
two years at an academy in Stafford County kept
by a Scotch parson named Buchan, “a pious man
and profound classical scholar.” Afterwards John
Mason was sent to study mathematics with an expert
named Hunter, “a Scotchman also and quite a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
recluse, who kept a small school in a retired place
in Calvert County, Maryland.” Much teaching
was also done by private tutors. In the Mason
household these were three Scotchmen in succession,
of whom “the two last were especially engaged
[in Scotland] to come to America (as was
the practice in those times with families who had
means) by my father to live in his house and educate
the children.... The tutoress of my sisters
was a Mrs. Newman. She remained in the family
for some time.”<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a></p>

<div id="Convicts_as_tutors" class="sidenote">Convicts as
tutors.</div>

<p>Sometimes the schoolmaster or private tutor was
an indented white servant who had come out as a
redemptioner, or even as a convict. Among the
criminals there might be persons of rank,
as Sir Charles Burton, a Lincolnshire
baronet, who was transported to America in 1722
for “stealing a cornelian ring set in gold;” or
scholars, like Henry Justice, Esq., of the Middle
Temple, Barrister, who in 1736 was convicted of
stealing from the library of Trinity College, Cambridge,
“a Field’s Bible with cuts, and Common-prayer,
value £25, Newcastle’s Horsemanship,
value £10, several other books of great value,
several Tracts cut out of books, etc.” For this
larceny, although Mr. Justice begged hard to be
allowed to stay in England for the sake of his
clients, “with several of whom he had great concerns,”
he was nevertheless sent to America for
seven years, under penalty of death if he were to return
within that time.<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> From such examples we see
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
that, while the convict ships may not have brought
many Eugene Arams, they certainly brought men
more likely to find employment in teaching than in
manual labour. Jonathan Boucher, rector at Annapolis
in 1768, declares that “not a ship arrives
with either redemptioners or convicts, in which
schoolmasters are not as regularly advertised for
sale as weavers, tailors, or any other trade; with
little other difference that I can hear of, except
perhaps that the former do not usually fetch so
good a price as the latter.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<div id="Virginians_at_Oxford" class="sidenote">Virginians
at Oxford.</div>

<p>Sometimes, as we have seen in the case of Augustine
Washington and his son Lawrence, the
young Virginians were sent to school in
England. Oftener, perhaps, the education
begun at the country school or with private
tutors was “finished” (as the phrase goes) at one
of the English universities. Oxford seems to have
been the favourite Alma Mater, doubtless for the
same reason that caused Cambridge to be chiefly
represented among the founders of New England;
Oxford was ultra-royalist in sentiment, while Cambridge
was deeply tinged with Puritanism. This
difference would readily establish habits and associations
among the early Virginians which would
be followed.<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span></p>

<div id="James_Madison" class="sidenote">James Madison.</div>

<p>It was not in all cases necessary to go to England
to obtain a thorough education. James Madison’s
tutors were the parish minister and
an excellent Scotch schoolmaster; he was
graduated at Princeton College in 1772, and never
crossed the Atlantic; yet for the range, depth, and
minuteness of his knowledge of ancient and modern
history and of constitutional law, he has been
rivalled by no other English-speaking statesman
save Edmund Burke. Such an instance, however,
chiefly shows how much more depends upon the
individual than upon any institutions. There are
no rules by which you can explain the occurrence
of a heaven-sent genius.</p>

<div id="Contrast_with_New_England_in_respect_of_educational_advantages" class="sidenote">Contrast
with New
England in
respect of
educational
advantages.</div>

<p>On the whole, the facilities for education, whether
primary or advanced, were very imperfect in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
Old Dominion. This becomes especially noticeable
from the contrast with New England,
which inevitably suggests itself. It is no
doubt customary with historical writers
to make too much of this contrast. The
people of colonial New England were not all well-educated,
nor were all their country schools better
than old field schools. The farmer’s boy, who was
taught for two winter months by a man and two
summer months by a woman, seldom learned more
in the district school than how to read, write, and
cipher. For Greek and Latin, if he would go to
college, he had usually to obtain the services of the
minister or some other college-bred man in the village.
There was often a disposition on the part of
the town meetings to shirk the appropriation of a
sum of money for school purposes, and many Massachusetts
towns were fined for such remissness.<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>
This was especially true of the early part of the
eighteenth century, when the isolated and sequestered
life of two generations had lowered the high
level of education which the grandfathers had
brought across the ocean. In those dark days of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
New England, there might now and then be found
in rural communities men of substance who signed
deeds and contracts with their mark.</p>

<div id="Causes_of_the_difference" class="sidenote">Causes of
the difference.</div>

<p>After making all allowances, however, the contrast
between the New England colonies and the
Old Dominion remains undeniable, and it is full of
interest. The contrast is primarily based upon the
fact that New England was settled by
a migration of organized congregations,
analogous to that of the ancient Greek
city-communities; whereas the settlement of Virginia
was effected by a migration of individuals
and families. These circumstances were closely
connected with the Puritan doctrine of the relations
between church and state, and furthermore,
as I have elsewhere shown,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> the Puritan theory of
life made it imperatively necessary, in New England
as in Scotland, to set a high value upon
education. The compactness of New England life,
which was favoured by the agricultural system of
small farms owned by independent yeomen, made
it easy to maintain efficient schools. In Virginia,
on the other hand, the agricultural conditions interposed
grave obstacles to such a result. There
was no such pervasive organization as in New England,
where the different grades of school, from
lowest to highest, coöperated in sustaining each
other. There were heroic friends of education in
Virginia. James Blair and the faithful scholars
who worked with him conferred a priceless boon
upon the commonwealth; but the vitality of William
and Mary College often languished for lack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span>
of sustenance that should have been afforded by
lower schools, and it was impossible for it to exercise
such a widespread seminal influence as Yale
and Harvard, sending their graduates into every
town and village as ministers, lawyers, and doctors,
schoolmasters and editors, merchants and
country squires.</p>

<div id="Illustrations_from_the_history_of_American_intellect" class="sidenote">Illustrations
from
history of
American
intellect.</div>

<p>Among the founders of New England were an
extraordinary number of clergymen noted for their
learning, such as Hooker and Shepard, Cotton and
Williams, Eliot and the Mathers; together with
such cultivated laymen as Winthrop and Bradford,
familiar with much of the best that was written in
the world, and to whom the pen was an easy and
natural instrument for expressing their thoughts.
The character originally impressed upon New England
by such men was maintained by the powerful
influence of the colleges and schools, so that there
was always more attention devoted to scholarship
and to writing than in any of the other colonies.
Communities of Europeans, thrust into a wilderness
and severed from Europe by the ocean, were
naturally in danger of losing their higher culture
and lapsing into the crudeness of frontier life.
All the American colonies were deeply affected by
this situation. While there were many and great
advantages in the freedom from sundry Old World
trammels, yet in some respects the influence of the
wilderness was barbarizing. It was due to the
circumstances above mentioned that the New England
colonies were more successful than the others
in resisting this influence, and avoiding a breach of
continuity in the higher spiritual life of the community.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span>
This is strikingly illustrated by the history
of American literature. Among men
of letters and science born and educated
in America before the Revolution, there
were three whose fame is more than national,
whose names belong among the great of all
times and countries. Of these, Jonathan Edwards
was a native of Connecticut, Benjamin Franklin
and Count Rumford were natives of Massachusetts.
In such men we can trace the continuity
between the intellectual life of England in the
seventeenth century and that of America in the
nineteenth. In Virginia, if we except political
writers, we find no names so high as these. But
there is one political book which must not be excepted,
because it is a book for all time. “The
Federalist” is one of the world’s philosophical
and literary masterpieces, and of its three authors

<p>Among books of a second order,&mdash;books which
do not rank among classics,&mdash;there are some which
deserve and have won a reputation that is more
than local. Of such books, Hutchinson’s “History
of Massachusetts Bay” is a good example. In
the colonial times historical literature was of better
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
quality than other kinds of writing; and Virginia
produced three historical writers of decided merit.
With Robert Beverley the reader has already
made some acquaintance through
the extracts cited in these pages. His
“History of Virginia,” published in London in
1705, is a little book full of interesting details
concerning the country and the life of its red and
white inhabitants. The author’s love of nature
is charming, and his style so simple, direct, and
sprightly that there is not a dull page in the book.
It was written during a visit to London, where
Beverley happened to see the proof-sheets of Oldmixon’s
forthcoming “British Empire in America,”
and was disgusted with the silly blunders that
swarmed on every page. He wrote his little book
as an antidote, and did it so well that many coming
generations will read it with pleasure.</p>

<div id="William_Stith" class="sidenote">William
Stith.</div>

<p>A book of more pretension and of decided merit
is the “History of Virginia” by Rev. William
Stith, who was president of William and
Mary College from 1752 to his death in
1755. The book, which was published at Williamsburg
in 1747, was but the first volume of a work
which, had it been completed on a similar scale,
would have filled six or eight. It covers only the
earliest period, ending with the downfall of the Virginia
Company in 1624; and among its merits is
the good use to which the author put the minutes of
the Company’s proceedings made at the instance
of Nicholas Ferrar.<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> Stith’s work is accurate and
scholarly, and his narrative is dignified and often
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
graphic. His account of James I. is pithy: “He
had, in truth, all the forms of wisdom,&mdash;forever
erring very learnedly, with a wise saw or Latin
sentence in his mouth; for he had been bred up
under Buchanan, one of the brightest geniuses
and most accomplished scholars of that age, who
had given him Greek and Latin in great waste
and profusion, but it was not in his power to give
him good sense. That is the gift of God and
nature alone, and is not to be taught; and Greek
and Latin without it only cumber and overload a
a weak head, and often render the fool more
abundantly foolish. I must, therefore, confess that
I have ever had ... a most contemptible opinion
of this monarch; which has, perhaps, been much
heightened and increased by my long studying and
conning over the materials of this history. For he
appears in his dealings with the Company to have
acted with such mean arts and fraud ... as highly
misbecome majesty.”<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a> From the refined simplicity
of this straightforward style it was a sad descent
to the cumbrous and stilted Johnsonese of
the next generation, which too many Americans
even now mistake for fine writing.</p>

<div id="William_Byrd" class="sidenote">William
Byrd.</div>

<p>Contemporary with Beverley and Stith was
William Byrd, one of the most eminent men of
affairs in Old Virginia, and eminent also&mdash;probably
without knowing it&mdash;as a
man of letters. His father came to Virginia a
few years before Bacon’s rebellion, and bought the
famous estate of Westover, on the James River
and in Charles City County, with the mansion,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span>
which is still in the possession of his family, and
is considered one of the finest old houses in Virginia.
From his uncle Colonel Byrd inherited a
vast estate which included the present site of Richmond.
He sympathized strongly with his neighbour,
Nathaniel Bacon, and held a command under
him; but after the collapse of the rebellion he
succeeded in making his peace with the raging
Berkeley. He became one of the most important
men in the colony, and was commissioned receiver-general
of the royal revenues. On his death, in
1704, his son succeeded him in this office. The
son had studied law in the Middle Temple, and
for proficiency in science was made a fellow of the
Royal Society. He was for many years a member
of the colonial council, and at length its president.
He lived in much splendour on his estate of Westover,
and we have seen what a library he accumulated
there. A professional man of letters he
was not, and perhaps his strong literary tastes
might never have led to literary production but
for sundry interesting personal experiences which
he deemed it worth while to put on record. In 1727
he was one of the commissioners for determining
the boundary between Virginia and North Carolina.
In the journeys connected with that work
he selected the sites where the towns of Richmond
and Petersburg were afterwards built; and he
wrote a narrative of his proceedings so full of
keen observations on the people and times as to
make it an extremely valuable contribution to history.<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a>
Among early American writers Byrd is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span>
exceptional for animation of style. There is a
quaintness of phrase about him that is quite irrepressible.
After a dry season he visits a couple
of mills, and “had the grief to find them both
stand as still for the want of water as a dead
woman’s tongue for want of breath. It had rained
so little for many weeks above the falls that the
Naiads had hardly water enough left to wash their
faces.” He suggests, of course with a twinkle in
his eye, that the early settlers of Virginia ought
to have formed matrimonial alliances with the
Indians: “Morals and all considered, I can’t
think the Indians were much greater heathens
than the first adventurers, who, had they been
good Christians, would have had the charity to
take this only method of converting the natives
to Christianity. For after all that can be said, a
sprightly lover is the most prevailing missionary
that can be sent among these, or any other infidels.
Besides, the poor Indians would have had less reason
to complain that the English took away their
land, if they had received it by way of portion
with their daughters.... Nor would the shade of
the skin have been any reproach at this day; for
if a Moor may be washed white in three generations,
surely an Indian might have been blanched
in two.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a> With such moralizing was this amiable
writer wont to relieve the tedium of historical discourse.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
We shall again have occasion to quote
him in the course of our narrative.</p>

<div id="Jeffersons_notes_on_Virginia" class="sidenote">Science;
John Clayton.</div>

<p>Among other works by writers reared before the
Revolution, the well-known “Notes on Virginia,”
by Thomas Jefferson, deserves high praise as an
essay in descriptive sociology. Of American poetry
before the nineteenth century, scarcely a line worth
preserving came from any quarter. In 1777 James
McClurg, an eminent physician, afterward a member
of the Federal Convention, wrote his “Belles
of Williamsburg,” a specimen of pleasant society
verse; but it had not such vogue as its author’s
“Essay on the Human Bile,” which was translated
into several European languages. Science throve
better than poetry, and was well represented
in Virginia by John Clayton, who
came thither from England in 1705,
being then in his twentieth year, and dwelt there
until his death in 1773, on the eve of the famous
day which saw the mixing of tea with ice-water in
Boston harbour. Clayton was attorney-general of
Virginia, and for fifty years clerk of Gloucester
County. His name has an honourable place in the
history of botany; he was member of learned societies
in nearly all the countries of Europe; and
in 1739 his “Flora of Virginia” was edited and
published by Linnæus and Gronovius.</p>

<div id="Washingtons_last_illness" class="sidenote">Washington’s
last
illness.</div>

<p>In Old Virginia, as in all the other colonies,
the scientific study and practice of medicine had
scarcely made a beginning. Those were
everywhere the days of “kill or cure”
treatment, when there was small hope for patients
who had not enough vitality to withstand both
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
drugs and disease. In the light of the progress
achieved since the mighty work of Bichat (1798-1801),
the two preceding centuries seem a period
of stagnation. Strong plasters, jalap, and bleeding
were the universal remedies. Mr. Bruce gives us
the items of a bill rendered by Dr. Haddon, of
York, about 1660, for performing an amputation.
“They included one highly flavoured and two ordinary
cordials, three ointments for the wound, an
ointment precipitate, the operation of letting blood,
a purge <i>per diem</i>, two purges electuaries, external
applications, a cordial and two astringent powders,
phlebotomy, a defensive and a large cloth.” On
another occasion the same doctor prescribed “a
purging glister, a caphalick and a cordial electuary,
oil of spirits and sweet almonds, a purging and a
cordial bolus, purging pills, ursecatory, and oxymell.
His charge for six visits after dark was a
hogshead of tobacco weighing 400 pounds.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a> Of
the many thousand victims of these heroic methods,
the most illustrious was George Washington, who,
but for medical treatment, might probably have
lived a dozen or fifteen years into the nineteenth
century. When Washington in full vigour
found that he had caught a very bad
cold he sent for the doctors, and meanwhile
had half a pint of blood taken from him by
one of his overseers. Of the three physicians in
attendance, one was his dear friend, the good
Scotchman, Dr. James Craik, “who from forty
years’ experience,” said Washington, “is better
qualified than a dozen of them put together.” His
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
colleague, Dr. Elisha Dick, said, “Do not bleed
the General; he needs all his strength.” But tradition
prevailed over common sense, and three
copious bleedings followed, in the last of which a
quart of blood was taken. The third attendant,
Dr. Gustavus Brown, afterward expressed bitter
regret that Dr. Dick’s advice was not followed.
Besides this wholesale bleeding, the patient was
dosed with calomel and tartar emetic and scarified
with blisters and poultices; or, as honest Tobias
Lear said, in a letter written the next day announcing
the fatal result, “every medical assistance
was offered, but without the desired effect.”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a></p>

<div id="Some_Virginia_parsons" class="sidenote">Virginia
parsons.</div>

<p>The physician in Old Virginia was very much
the same as elsewhere, but the parson was a very
different character from the grave ministers and
dominies of Boston and New York. He belonged
to the class of wine-bibbing, card-playing, fox-hunting
parsons, of which there were so many examples
in the mother country after the reaction
against Puritanism had set in. The religious
tone of the English church during
the first half of the eighteenth century was very
low, and it was customary to send out to Virginia
and Maryland the poorest specimens of clergymen
that the mother country afforded. Men unfit
for any appointment at home were thought good
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
enough for the colonies. The royal governor,
as vicegerent of the sovereign, was head of the
colonial church, while ecclesiastical affairs were
superintended by a commissary appointed by the
Bishop of London. The first commissary, Dr.
Blair, as we have seen, was president of the college,
and in his successors those two offices were
usually united. Several attempts were made to
substitute a bishop for the commissary, but the
only result of the attempts was to alienate people’s
sympathies from the church, while the conduct of
the clergy was such as to destroy their respect for
it. Bishop Meade has queer stories to tell of some
of these parsons. One of them was for years the
president of a jockey club. Another fought a duel
within sight of his own church. A third, who was
evidently a muscular Christian, got into a rough-and-tumble
fight with his vestrymen and floored
them; and then justified himself to his congregation
next Sunday in a sermon from a text of
Nehemiah, “And I contended with them, and
cursed them, and smote certain of them, and
plucked off their hair.” In 1711 a bequest of
£100 was made to the vestry of Christ Church
parish in Middlesex, providing that the interest
should be paid to the minister for preaching four
sermons each year against “the four reigning
vices,&mdash;viz.: atheism and irreligion, swearing and
cursing, fornication and adultery, and drunkenness.”
Later in the century the living was held
for eighteen years, and the sermons were preached,
by a minister who was notoriously guilty of all the
vices mentioned. He used to be seen in the tavern
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
porch, reeling to and fro with a bowl of toddy in
his hand, while he called to some passer-by to
come in and have a drink. When this exemplary
man of God was dying in delirium, his last words
were halloos to the hounds. In 1726 a thoughtful
and worthy minister named Lang wrote to the
Bishop of London about the scandalous behaviour
of the clergy, of whom the sober part were “slothful
and negligent,” while the rest were debauched
and “bent on all manner of vices.”<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> This testimony
against the clergy, it will be observed, comes
from clergymen. Yet it seems clear that the cases
cited must have been extreme ones,&mdash;cases of the
sort that make a deep impression and are long
remembered. A few such instances would suffice
to bring down condemnation upon the whole establishment;
and not unjustly, for a church in
which such things could for a moment be tolerated
must needs have been in a degraded condition.
This state of things afforded an excellent field for
the labours of Baptist and Presbyterian revivalist
preachers, and to such good purpose did they work
that by the time of the Revolution it was found
that more than half of the people in Virginia were
Dissenters. At that time the Episcopal clergy
were not unnaturally inclined to the Tory side, and
this last ounce was all that was needed to break
down the establishment and cast upon it irredeemable
discredit. The downfall of the Episcopal
church in Virginia and its resurrection under more
wholesome conditions make an interesting chapter
of history.

<div id="Freethinking" class="sidenote">Freethinking.</div>

<p>In imputing to his tipsy parson the “vice” of
atheism, Bishop Meade warns us that he does not
mean a denial of the existence of God, but merely
irreligion, or “living without God in the world.”
In 1724 the Bishop of London was officially informed
that there were no “infidels” in Virginia,
negroes and Indians excepted. A few years later,
“when the first infidel book was imported, ... it
produced such an excitement that the governor
and commissary communicated on the subject with
the authorities in England.” In those
days freethinkers, if prudent, kept their
thoughts to themselves. All over Christendom the
atmosphere was still murky with intolerance, and
men’s conceptions of the universe were only beginning
to emerge from the barbaric stage. Virginia
was no exception to the general rule.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Superstition
and crime.</div>

<p>In respect also of superstition and crime the Old
Dominion seems to have differed but little from
other parts of English America. Belief
in witchcraft lasted into the eighteenth
century, and the statute-book reveals an abiding
dread of what rebellious slaves might do; but there
were no epidemics of savage terror, as at Salem in
1692, or in the negro panic of 1741 in New York.
Of violent crime there was surely much less than
in the England of Jack Sheppard and Jonathan
Wild, but probably more than in the colonies north
of Delaware Bay; and its perpetrators seem to
have been chiefly white freedmen and “outlying
negroes.”<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a> Duelling seems to have been infrequent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
before the Revolution.<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> Murder, rape, arson,
and violent robbery were punished with death;
while pillory, stocks, whipping-post, and ducking-stool
were kept in readiness for minor offenders.
The infliction of the death penalty in a cruel or
shocking manner was not common. Negroes were
occasionally burned at the stake, as in other colonies,
north and south; and an instance is on record
in which negro murderers were beheaded and quartered
after hanging.<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> No white persons were ever
burned at the stake by any of the colonies.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span></p>

<div id="Lawyers" class="sidenote">Lawyers.</div>

<p>In the early days of Virginia there was not
much practice of law except by the county magistrates
in their work of maintaining the
king’s peace. The legal profession was
at first held in somewhat low repute, being sometimes
recruited by white freedmen whose careers of
rascality as attorneys in England had suddenly
ended in penal servitude. But after the middle of
the seventeenth century the profession grew rapidly
in importance and improved in character. During
the eighteenth century the development in legal
learning and acumen, and in weight of judicial
authority, was remarkable. The profession was
graced by such eminent names as Pendleton,
Wythe, and Henry, until in John Marshall the
Old Dominion gave to the world a name second to
none among the great judges of English race and
speech.</p>

<div id="A_government_of_laws" class="sidenote">A government
of
laws.</div>

<p>One cause of this splendid development of legal
talent was doubtless the necessarily close connection
between legal and political activity. The Virginia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
planter meant that his government should be
one of laws. With his extensive estates
to superintend and country interests
to look after, his position was in many
respects like that of the country squire in England.
In his House of Burgesses the planter had a parliament;
and in the royal governor, who was liable
to subordinate local to imperial interests, there
was an abiding source of antagonism and distrust,
requiring him to keep his faculties perpetually
alert to remember all the legal maxims by which
the liberties of England had been guarded since
the days of Glanvil and Bracton. On the whole,
it was a noble type of rural gentry that the Old
Dominion had to show. Manly simplicity, love
of home and family, breezy activity, disinterested
public spirit, thorough wholesomeness and integrity,&mdash;such
were the features of the society whose
consummate flower was George Washington.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div id="Some_characteristics_of_Maryland" class="sidenote">Some characteristics
of
Maryland.</div>

<p>This chapter must not close without a brief mention
of the social features of Maryland, but a brief
mention is all that is needed for my purpose, since
the portraiture just given of Leah will answer in
most respects for her younger sister Rachel. The
English colonists in Maryland were of the same
excellent class as the Cavaliers who were the
strength of Virginia. Though tidewater Virginia
at the beginning of the eighteenth century contained
but few people who did not belong
to the Church of England, on the
other hand, in Maryland, not more than
one sixth of the white population belonged to that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
church, while one twelfth were Roman Catholics,
and three fourths were Puritans. But these differences
in religion did not run parallel with differences
in birth, refinement, or wealth. Naturally,
from the circumstances under which the colony
was founded, some of the best human material
was always to be found among the Catholics; and
they wielded an influence disproportionately greater
than their numbers.</p>

<p>For the first three generations tobacco played as
important a part in Maryland as in Virginia.
Nearly all the people became planters. Cheap
labour was supplied at first by indented white
servants and afterwards by negro slaves, who never
came, however, to number more than from one
fourth to one third of the whole population. There
was the same isolation, the same absence of towns,
the same rudeness of roads and preference for
water-ways, as in Virginia. The facilities for education
were somewhat poorer; there was no university
or college, no public schools until 1728, no
newspaper until 1745.</p>

<p>But early in the eighteenth century there came
about an important modification of industries, which
was in large part due to the rapid growth of Maryland’s
neighbour, Pennsylvania. In the latter
colony a great deal of wheat was raised, and the
export of flour became very profitable. This wheat
culture extended into Maryland, where wheat soon
became a vigorous rival of tobacco. In 1729 the
town of Baltimore was founded, and at once rose to
importance as a point for exporting flour. Moreover,
as Pennsylvania exported various kinds of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
farm produce, besides large quantities of valuable
furs, and as she had no seacoast and no convenient
maritime outlet save Philadelphia, her export trade
soon came to exceed the capacities of that outlet,
and a considerable part of it went through Baltimore,
which thus had a large and active rural district
dependent upon it, and grew so fast that by
1770 it had become the fourth city in English
America, with a population of nearly 20,000. The
growth of Annapolis was further stimulated by
these circumstances; and this development of town
life, with the introduction of a wealthy class of
merchants and the continual intercommunication
with Pennsylvania, went far toward assimilating
Maryland with the middle colonies while it diminished
to some extent her points of resemblance to
the Old Dominion.

<span id="The_Carolina_frontier">THE CAROLINA FRONTIER.</span></h2>

<div class="sidenote">The Spanish
frontier.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The wilderness
frontier.</div>

<p>“St. Augustine, a Spanish garrison, being
planted to the southward of us about a hundred
leagues, makes Carolina a frontier to all the English
settlements on the Main.” These memorable
words, from the report of the governor
and council at Charleston to the lords
proprietors of Carolina in London, in the year
1708, have a deeper historic significance than was
realized by the men who wrote them. In a twofold
sense Carolina was a frontier country. It was
not only the border region where English and
Spanish America marched upon each other, but it
served for some time as a kind of backwoods for
Virginia. Until recently one of the most important
factors in American history has been the existence
of a perpetually advancing frontier, where
new territory has often had to be won by hard
fighting against its barbarian occupants, where
the life has been at once more romantic and more
sordid than on the civilized seaboard, and where
democracy has assumed its most distinctively
American features. The cessation of these circumstances
will probably be one of the foremost
among the causes which are going to make America
in the twentieth century different from America in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
the nineteenth. Now for the full development of
this peculiar frontier life two conditions were requisite,&mdash;first,
the struggle with the wilderness;
secondly, isolation from the currents of European
thought with which the commercial seaboard was
kept in contact. These conditions were
first realized in North Carolina, and there
was originated the type of backwoods life
which a century later prevailed among the settlers
of Tennessee and Kentucky. That was the one
point where the backwoods may be said to have
started at the coast; and in this light we shall
have to consider it. On the other hand, South
Carolina, with the Georgia colony for its buffer, is
to be considered more in the light of a frontier
against the Spaniard. We shall have furthermore
to contemplate the whole Carolina coast as preeminently
the frontier upon which were wrecked
the last remnants of the piracy and buccaneering
that had grown out of the mighty Elizabethan
world-struggle between England and Spain. Without
some mention of all these points, our outline
sketch of the complicated drama begun by Drake
and Raleigh would be incomplete.</p>

<div id="The_grant_of_Carolina" class="sidenote">The grant of
Carolina.</div>

<p>The region long vaguely known as Carolina, or
at least a portion of it, had formed part of Sir
Walter Raleigh’s Virginia; the Spaniards had
never ceased to regard it as part of Florida. In
defiance of their claims, Jean Ribaut planted his
first ill-fated Huguenot colony at Port Royal in
1562, and built a fort which he called Charlesfort,
after Charles IX. of France. Whether the name
“Carolina” was applied to the territory at that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
early time is doubtful,<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> but we find it used in England,
in the time of Charles I., when the first Lord
Baltimore was entertaining a plan for a new colony
south of Virginia. The name finally served to
commemorate Charles II., who in 1663 granted
the territory to eight “lords proprietors,” gentlemen
who had done him inestimable services.
To the most eminent, George
Monk, Duke of Albemarle, he owed his restoration
to the throne; the support of Edward Hyde, Earl
of Clarendon, had been invaluable; the others
were Anthony Ashley Cooper, afterwards Earl of
Shaftesbury, Lord Craven, Lord Berkeley, and his
brother, Sir William Berkeley, governor of Virginia,
Sir George Carteret, and Sir John Colleton.
All these names appear to-day on the map,&mdash;Albemarle
Sound, Hyde, Craven, and Carteret counties
in North Carolina; Clarendon and Colleton counties,
Berkeley parish, and the Ashley and Cooper
rivers in South Carolina, while in Charleston we
have the name of the king.</p>

<div id="John_Locke_and_Lord_Shaftesbury" class="sidenote">Shaftesbury
and Locke.</div>

<p>These gentlemen contemplated founding a colony
which should emulate the success of Virginia.
The most actively engaged in the enterprise was
the one whom we know best by his title of Shaftesbury,
and it was thus that the founding of Carolina
became connected for a moment with one of the
greatest names in the history of England.
A charming story is that of the residence
of John Locke in the Ashley family, as physician,
private tutor, and general adviser and guardian
angel; how he once saved his lordship’s life by
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
most daring and skilful surgery, how he taught
Greek to the young Ashley, how he took the boy
at the age of seventeen to Haddon Hall and made
a happy match for him with pretty Lady Dorothy
Manners aged twenty, how he afterward assisted
at the birth of the grandson destined to become
even more famous in literature than the grandfather
in political history,&mdash;all this is pleasantly
told by the grandson. “My father was too young
and inexperienced to choose a wife for himself, and
my grandfather too much in business to choose
one for him. The affair was nice; for, though my
grandfather required not a great fortune, he insisted
on good blood, good person and constitution,
and, above all, good education and a character as
remote as possible from that of court or town-bred
lady. All this was thrown upon Mr. Locke, who
being ... so good a judge of men, my grandfather
doubted not of his equal judgment in
women. He departed from him, entrusted and
sworn, as Abraham’s head servant that ruled over
all that he had, and went into a far country (the
north of England) to seek for his son a wife, whom
he as successfully found.”<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a></p>

<div id="The_Fundamental_Constitutions" class="sidenote">The Fundamental
Constitutions.</div>

<p>In the summer of 1669, while the great philosopher
was engaged upon this match-making expedition,
he varied the proceedings by drawing up
a constitution for Carolina, the original draft of
which, a small neatly written volume of 75 pages
bound in vellum, is still preserved among the
Shaftesbury papers. This constitution diverges
widely in some respects from such a document as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
would have expressed Locke’s own ideas of the
right sort of government. The scheme
which it set forth was in the main Ashley’s,
with such modifications as were
necessary to secure the approval of the other proprietors.
It is not worth our while to recount its
complicated provisions, inasmuch as it was never
anything but a dead letter, and civil government
sprouted up as spontaneously in Carolina as if
neither statesman nor philosopher had ever given
thought to the subject. One provision, however,
expressed an idea of which Locke was one of the
foremost representatives, and herein Ashley agreed
with him; it was the idea of complete liberty of
conscience in matters of religion. It was provided
that any seven or more persons who could agree
among themselves upon any sort of notion about
God or any plan for worshipping him might set up
a church and be guaranteed against all interference
or molestation. An ideal so noble as this was
never quite realized in the history of any of the
colonies; but there can be little doubt that the
publication of Locke’s “Fundamental Constitutions”
in 1670, in 1682, and 1698 had much influence
in directing toward Carolina the stream of
Huguenot emigration from France, which was an
event of the first importance.<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a></p>

<div id="The_Carolina_palatinate" class="sidenote">The Carolina
Palatinate.</div>

<p>In its general character the government created
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
by the Fundamental Constitutions was a palatinate
modelled after that of Durham. The
difference between Carolina and Maryland
consisted chiefly in the fact that the
palatinate privileges were granted to eight co-proprietors
instead of a single proprietor. Those
privileges were quasi-royal, but they were limited
by giving to the popular assembly the control over
all money bills. This limitation, however, was
partly offset by giving to the higher officers regular
salaries payable from quit-rents or the sales
of public lands. These salaries went far toward
making such officers independent of the legislature,
and thus led to much complaint and dissatisfaction.
Before the Revolution, questions concerning
the salaried independence of high public officials
had in several of the colonies come to be one of
the most burning questions of the day.</p>

<div class="sidenote">The Palatine.</div>

<p>The lords proprietors, as tenants-in-chief of the
crown, were feudal sovereigns over Carolina. They
could grant estates on any terms they pleased, and
subinfeudation, which had been forbidden in England
since 1290, was expressly permitted here.
The eldest of the proprietors was called
the Palatine; he presided at their meetings,
and his vote with those of three associates
was reckoned a majority. As the proprietors remained
in England, it was arranged that each of
them should be represented in Carolina by a deputy;
and the Palatine’s deputy, sometimes called
Vice-Palatine, was to be governor of the colony.
But any one of the proprietors coming into the
colony, or the oldest of those coming, if there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
more than one, was to take precedence over everybody
and become at once Vice-Palatine.</p>

<div id="Titles_of_nobility" class="sidenote">Titles of
nobility.</div>

<p>By a curious provision of the charter, the lords
proprietors could grant titles of nobility, provided
they were unlike those used in England.
Hence the outlandish titles, such as
“landgrave” and “cacique,” which occur in the
Fundamental Constitutions. With the titles there
was combined an artificial system of social gradations
which is not worth recounting. As for the
political status of the settlers, they were guaranteed
in the possession of all the rights and privileges
enjoyed by Englishmen in England.</p>

<div id="Albemarle_colony" class="sidenote">The Albemarle
colony.</div>

<p>The planting of two distinct colonies in Carolina
was no part of the original scheme, but the early
centres of colonization were so far apart and communication
between them was so difficult that they
could not well be united in a single community,
although more than once there was a single governor
over the whole of Carolina. Emigration
from Virginia had begun as early as 1653, when
Roger Greene with a hundred men made a small
settlement in the Chowan precinct, on the north
shore of Albemarle Sound.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a> In 1662
George Durant<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a> followed, and began a
settlement in the Perquimans precinct,
just east of Chowan. In 1664 Governor Berkeley,
of Virginia,&mdash;himself one of the eight lords proprietors,&mdash;severed
this newly settled region from
Virginia, and appointed William Drummond as
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
its governor. Such were the beginnings of Albemarle,
the colony which in time was to develop
into North Carolina.</p>

<div id="New_Englanders_at_Cape_Fear" class="sidenote">The visit of

<p>Meanwhile in 1660 a party from New England
made a settlement at the mouth of Cape Fear
River; or perhaps we ought rather to call it a
visit. It lasted no longer than Thorfinn Karlsefni’s
visit to Vinland,<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a> for the settlers had all
departed by 1663. There is a tradition that they
were sorely harassed by the natives, in revenge for
their sending sundry Indian lads and girls aboard
ship, to be taken to Boston and “educated,” <i>i. e.</i>
sold for slaves.<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> This is not improbable.
At all events, these New Englanders went
off in a mood not altogether amiable,
leaving affixed to a post, at the mouth of the river,
a “scandalous writing ... the contents whereof
tended not only to the disparagement of the land
... but also to the great discouragement of all
such as should hereafter come into those parts to
settle.”<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a></p>

<div id="The_Clarendon_colony" class="sidenote">The Clarendon

<p>But this emphatic warning did not frighten
away Sir John Yeamans, who arrived at Cape Fear
early in October, 1663, and ascended the river for
more than a hundred and fifty miles. Sir John
was the son of a gallant Cavalier who had lost life
and estate in the king’s service, and he had come
out to Barbadoes to repair his fortunes.
His report of the Cape Fear country was
so favourable that by the end of May, 1665, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
find him there again, with several hundred settlers
from Barbadoes, to make the beginnings of the
new colony of Clarendon, of which the lords proprietors
had appointed him governor. In the same
year the colony of Albemarle elected its first assembly.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Founding of

<p>In 1667 William Sayle, a Puritan from Bermuda,
explored the coast, and reported the value
of the Bahama Islands for offensive and defensive
purposes in case of war with Spain. These islands
were accordingly appropriated and annexed to
Carolina, as the Bermudas had once been annexed
to Virginia. It was decided to make a
settlement at Port Royal; the venerable
Sayle, whose years were more than three-score-and-ten,
was appointed governor; and on
March 17, 1670, the first colonists arrived on the
Carolina coast. On further inspection Port Royal
seemed too much exposed to the attacks of Spaniards
from St. Augustine, and accordingly the
ships pursued their way northward till they reached
and entered the spacious bay formed by the junction
of two noble rivers since known as Ashley
and Cooper. They proceeded up the Ashley as
far as an easily defensible highland at Albemarle
Point, where they began building a village which
they called Charles Town. Their cautiousness
was soon justified. Spain and
England were then at peace, but no
sooner were the Spaniards notified of these proceedings
than a warship started from St. Augustine
and came as far as Stono Inlet, where it
learned the strength of the English position and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
concluded to retreat.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a> The next year Governor
Sayle died, and was succeeded by Sir John Yeamans,
who came in 1672, bringing from Barbadoes
the first negro slaves ever seen in Carolina. In
1674 Yeamans was superseded by Joseph West,
under whom the first assembly was elected.</p>

<p>Thus there were three small communities started
on the coast of Carolina: 1. Albemarle, on the
Virginia border, constituted in 1664; 2. Clarendon,
on the Cape Fear River, in 1665; 3. The
Ashley River colony, in 1670.</p>

<div id="First_legislation_in_Albemarle" class="sidenote">First legislation
in
Albemarle.</div>

<p>For a moment we must follow the fortunes of
Albemarle, where in 1667 Drummond was succeeded
in the governorship by Samuel Stephens.
Two years later there was passed a statute which
enacted that no subject could be sued
within five years for any cause of action
that might have arisen outside of the
colony; that all debts contracted outside of the
colony were <i>ipso facto</i> outlawed; and that all
new settlers should be exempted from taxes for
one year.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> Moreover, all “transient persons,”
not intending to remain in the colony, were forbidden
to trade with the Indians. It was furthermore
provided that, since there were no clergymen
in the colony to perform the ceremony of marriage,
a declaration of mutual consent, before the
governor and council and in the presence of a few
acquaintances, should be deemed a binding contract.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
These laws were of course intended to
stimulate immigration, and the effect of the first
two was soon plainly indicated in the indignant
epithet, “Rogue’s Harbour,” bestowed by Virginia
people upon the colony of Albemarle.<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a></p>

Act.</div>

<div id="The_trade_with_New_England" class="sidenote">The trade
with New
England.</div>

<p>The desire of increasing the number of settlers,
without regard to their quality, induced the lords
proprietors to sanction these curiosities of legislation.
But troubles, not of their own creating,
were at hand in this little forest community.
In 1673 the Fundamental Constitutions were
promulgated by Governor Stephens, who soon
afterward died. Under his temporary successor,
George Carteret, president of the council,
the troubles broke out, and it has
been customary to ascribe them to the
attempt to enforce the Fundamental Constitutions
upon an unwilling community. It does not appear,
however, that the official promulgation of
this frame of government was followed by any
serious attempts to enforce it.<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> The real source of
the disturbances was undoubtedly the Navigation
Act,&mdash;that mischievous statute with which the
mother country was busily weaning from itself the
affections of its colonies all along the American
seaboard. Sundry unfounded rumours increased
the bitter feeling. The king’s grant of Virginia
to Arlington and Culpeper in 1673 was part of
the news of the day. It was reported that the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
proprietors of Carolina were going to divide up
the province among themselves, and that Albemarle
was to be the share of Sir William Berkeley,
a man especially hated by the Virginians of small
means, who were the larger part of the Albemarle
population. Though these reports were
baseless, they found many believers. But the
Navigation Act and the attempts to break up the
trade with Massachusetts were very real
grievances. Ships from Boston and Salem
brought down to Albemarle Sound
all manner of articles needed by the planters, and
took their pay in cattle and lumber, which they
carried to the West Indies and exchanged for
sugar, molasses, and rum. Often with this cargo
they returned to Albemarle and exchanged it for
tobacco, which they carried home and sent off
to Europe at a good round profit, in supreme defiance
of the statutes. It was said that the new
colony was enriching Yankee merchants much
faster than the lords proprietors.<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a> In truth the
trade was profitable to merchants and planters
alike, and by the summer of 1676 sundry attempts
to break it up had brought the little colony
into quite a rebellious frame of mind. We have
seen how Bacon looked forward to possible help
from Carolina against Sir William Berkeley.
Bacon spoke of the desirableness of the people
electing their own governors.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a> New England furnished
examples of such elected governors who
were in full sympathy with the people. The men
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
of Albemarle were likely to make trouble for
governors appointed in England to carry out an
unpopular policy.</p>

<div id="Eastchurch_and_Miller" class="sidenote">Eastchurch
and Miller.</div>

<p>When Carteret resigned his position in 1676,
two men, who were supposed to represent the popular
party, had lately gone over to England. One
of them, by name Eastchurch, had been
speaker of the assembly; and so anxious
were the lords proprietors to have their intentions
carried out without irritating the people, that in
the autumn of 1676 they appointed him governor
of Albemarle. The other was a person named
Miller, who had been illegally carried to Virginia
and tried by Governor Berkeley for making a
seditious speech in Carolina. In England he
found it profitable to pose as a martyr. The proprietors
made him secretary of Albemarle, and
the king’s commissioners of customs made him
collector of the revenues of that colony. Early
in 1677 the new governor and secretary sailed for
America, and made a stop at the little island of
Nevis, famous in later years as the birthplace of
Alexander Hamilton. For Eastchurch it proved
to be an isle of Calypso. He fell in love with
a fair Creole and staid to press his suit, while
he appointed Miller president of the council, and
sent him on in that capacity to govern Albemarle.</p>

<div id="Culpepers_usurpation" class="sidenote">The Culpeper
usurpation,
1677-79.</div>

<p>That little commonwealth of less than 3,000
souls had in the mean time been enjoying the
sweets of uncurbed liberty, when there was no
king in Israel, and every man did what was right
in his own eyes. Miller, as a martyr to free
speech, was cordially welcomed, but as proprietary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
governor and king’s collector, he found his popularity
quickly waning. He tried to suppress the
trade with Massachusetts, and thus arrayed against
himself the Yankee skippers, aided by a “party
within,” at the head of which was the wealthy
George Durant, the earliest settler of Perquimans.
The train was well laid for an insurrection when
a demagogue arrived with the match to fire it.
This man was John Culpeper, surveyor-general of
Carolina, whose seditious conduct on the Ashley
River had lately made it necessary for him to flee
northward to escape the hangman. Culpeper’s
proposal to resist the enforcement of the odious
Navigation Act brought him many followers. In
December, 1677, a Yankee schooner,
heavily armed and bearing a seductive
cargo of rum and molasses, appeared in
Pasquotank River. Her skipper, whose name was
Gillam, had scarcely set foot on land when he
was arrested by the governor and held to bail in
£1,000. The astute Yankee, with an air of innocent
surprise, meekly promised to weigh anchor at
once and not return. Hereupon a thirsty mob,
maddening with the thought of losing so much
rum, beset Gillam with entreaties to stay. Governor
Miller was a man in whom bravery prevailed
over prudence, and, hearing at this moment
that Durant was on the schooner, he straightway
boarded her, pistol in hand, and arrested that influential
personage on a charge of treason. This
rash act was the signal for an explosion. Culpeper’s
mob arrested the governor and council,
and locked them up. Then they took possession
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
of the public records, convened the assembly,
appointed new justices, made Culpeper governor,
and, seizing upon £3,000 of customs revenue collected
by Miller for the king, they applied it to
the support of this revolutionary government.</p>

<p>For two years these adventurers exercised full
sway over Albemarle. During this time Governor
Eastchurch arrived from the island of Nevis,
bringing with him the fair Creole as his bride.
He met with a cold reception, and lost no time
in finding shelter in Virginia, where he drank a
friendly glass with Governor Chicheley, and asked
for military aid against the usurping Culpeper.
The request was granted, but before the troops
were ready the unfortunate Eastchurch succumbed
to chagrin, or perhaps to malaria, and his Creole
bride was left a widow.</p>

<div id="Charleston_moved_to_a_new_site" class="sidenote">Charleston

<p>Culpeper, however, remained in some dread of
what Virginia might do. He had issued a manifesto,
accusing Miller of tyranny and peculation
and seeking to justify himself; but he thought it
wise to play a still bolder part. He went to England
in the hope of persuading the lords
proprietors to sanction what he had
done, and to confirm him in the governorship.
In London he was surprised at meeting
the deposed Miller, who had broken jail and
arrived there before him. The twain forthwith
told their eloquent but conflicting tales of woe,
and Culpeper’s tongue proved the more persuasive
with the lords proprietors. He seemed on the
point of returning in triumph to Carolina, when
suddenly the king’s officers arrested him for robbing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span>
the custom-house of £3,000. This led to his
trial for treason, in the summer of 1680, before the
King’s Bench, under the statute of Henry VIII.
anent “treason committed abroad;” the same
statute under which it was sought, on a fine April
morning ninety-five years later, to arrest Samuel
Adams and John Hancock. The Earl of Shaftesbury
ably defended Culpeper, and he was acquitted
but not restored to power.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> He returned
to Carolina, a sadder if not a wiser man; and in
his old capacity of surveyor, it is said, laid out
the plan of the city of Charleston on its present
site. The original Charles Town, as already mentioned,
was begun at Albemarle Point on Ashley
River, in 1670. Another settlement was made
two years later at Oyster Point, on the
extremity of the peninsula enclosed
between the two rivers. This new situation
had greater advantages for a seaport, and
its cooler breezes were appreciated by sojourners
in that fiery climate. It grew at the expense of
the older settlement, until in 1680 it had a population
of 2,500 souls, and took over the name of
Charles Town, while Albemarle Point was abandoned.
So the autumn of 1680 had work at
Oyster Point for a surveyor like Culpeper.</p>

<div id="Seth_Sothel" class="sidenote">Seth Sothel.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Banishment
of Sothel.</div>

<p>The governor who succeeded this usurper in the
Albemarle colony was a new lord proprietor,
by name Seth Sothel, to whom
the Earl of Clarendon had sold out his rights and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
interests. On his way to America, early in 1680,
Sothel was captured by Algerine pirates and carried
off into slavery. Not until 1683 did Sothel
obtain his freedom and arrive at his destination.
In five years of misrule over Albemarle he proved
himself one of the dirtiest knaves that ever held
office in America. A few specimens of his conduct
may be cited. On the arrival of two ships
from Barbadoes on legitimate business, Sothel
seized them as pirates and threw their captains
into jail, where one of them died of ill-treatment.
The dying man made a will in which he named one
of the most respected men in the colony, Thomas
Pollock, as his executor; but Sothel refused to let
the will go to probate, and seized the dead man’s
effects; the executor then threatened to carry the
story of all this to England, whereupon the governor
lodged him in jail and kept him there.
George Durant called such proceedings unlawful,
whereupon Sothel straightway imprisoned him and
confiscated his whole estate. If he saw anything
that pleased his fancy, be it a cow or a negro or a
pewter dish, he just took it without ceremony, and
if the owner objected he locked him up. From
criminals he took tips and saved them from the
gallows. The people of Albemarle endured this
tyranny until 1688,&mdash;that year when over all
English lands the sky was so black with political
thunder-clouds. One day certain leading colonists
laid hands upon Seth Sothel, and prepared to send
him to England to be tried for a long list of felonies.
Then this model for governors and lords
proprietors, suddenly realizing the dismal prospect
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
before him, with Tyburn looming up in the distance,
begged with frantic sobs and tears that he
might be tried by the assembly, and not be sent
to England; for he felt sure that the assembly
would hardly dare take the responsibility
of hanging him. In this he calculated
correctly; he was banished from the colony
for one year, and declared forever incapable of
holding the governorship.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a></p>

<p>The prudence of the assembly was well considered.
The lords proprietors in England, ill informed
as to the affairs of their colony, wearied
with the everlasting series of complaints, and unwilling
to believe that one of their associates could
be such a scoundrel, were inclined to scold the
colonists for their treatment of Sothel. As for
that worthy, his full career was not yet run. Scenes
of turbulence were awaiting him in the
little settlement between the Ashley and
Cooper rivers. Joseph West had ruled
there with a strong hand from 1674 to 1683, and
the colony prospered during that time, but disagreements
arose between West and the proprietors
which ended in his removal. The next seven
years were a period of anarchy. After five changes
of governors in quick succession, the office was
given to James Colleton, brother of Colleton the
lord proprietor, but the situation was not improved.
The troubles arose partly from the practice of kidnapping
Indians for slaves, which invited bloody
reprisals; partly from the demand that quit-rents
be paid in coin, which was very scarce in Carolina;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
partly from the low character of many of the settlers
and their dealings with pirates; partly from
the unwillingness of the English settlers to admit
the Huguenot immigrants to a share in the franchise;
and partly from the fitful and arbitrary
manner in which the lords proprietors tried from
beyond sea to cure the complicated evils. The
muddle was aggravated by Spanish hostility. In
1683 a few Scotch families were brought by Lord
Cardross to Port Royal, where they made the beginnings
of a settlement. Those were the
cruel days of Claverhouse in Scotland,
and a scheme was entertained for bringing
10,000 sturdy Covenanters to Carolina; but
it came to nothing. Cardross got into difficulties
with the people at Charleston, and went back to
Scotland in disgust. In 1686, in time of peace, a
Spanish force pounced upon Port Royal, murdered
some of the Scotchmen, flogged others within an
inch of their lives, carried off what booty they
could find, and left the place a smoking ruin. Dire
was the indignation of the Charleston men at these
“bloody insolencies.” Two stout ships with 400
men were just ready to sail against St. Augustine,
when the newly appointed Governor Colleton arrived
upon the scene and forbade their sailing.
His mandate was obeyed with growls and curses.
The lords proprietors upheld him. “No man,” as
they reasonably said, “can think that the dependencies
of England can have power to make war
upon the king’s allies without his knowledge or
consent.”<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> It was an inauspicious beginning for
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
Colleton. The old troubles continued, along with
others growing out of the Navigation Act. The
wrangling between governor and assembly grew so
hot that in 1689 the proprietors instructed Colleton
to summon no more parliaments in Carolina without
express orders from them. The effect of such
an order was probably not foreseen by those well-meaning
gentlemen. It was a curious feature in
the Ashley River colony that the acts of
its assembly expired at the end of twenty-three
months unless renewed. This term
had so nearly elapsed when the order arrived that
“in 1690 not one statute law was in force in the
colony!”<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a></p>

Things grew worse in the spring of 1690, when
Colleton proclaimed martial law. The air was thick
with sedition when Sothel arrived in Charleston.
As a lord proprietor he had the right to act as governor
over Colleton’s head. Several of the leading
colonists begged him to call a parliament, and forthwith
the exemplary Sothel posed as “the people’s
friend.” He summoned a parliament
which banished Colleton and enacted
sundry laws. A queer spectacle it was,
the victim of one popular revolution becoming the
ringleader of another, the banished playing the
part of banisher! But the lords proprietors had
become aware of Sothel’s misdeeds; they annulled
the acts of his parliament, deposed him, and ordered
him to return to England to answer the charges
against him. Sothel did not relish this. His term
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
of banishment from Albemarle had expired, and
he believed it to be a safer hiding-place
than London. Where he skulked or
how he died is unknown. All we know is that
his will was admitted to probate February 5, 1694;
and that his tombstone, which came from England,
was never paid for!<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a></p>

<div id="Clarendon_colony_abandoned" class="sidenote">Clarendon colony abandoned.</div>

<p>Since the founding of the Ashley River colony
it had fared ill with the Clarendon colony on
Cape Fear River, which under favouring circumstances
might perhaps have developed into a Middle
Carolina. There were not people enough, and
there was not trade enough for so many
settlements. So Clarendon dwindled until
1690, when it was abandoned. This
left a wide interval of forest and stream between
Albemarle and the Ashley River colony, or North
Carolina and South Carolina, as they were beginning
to be called. The formal separation of Carolina
into two provinces did not take place until
1729, but the two colonies were from the outset, as
we have seen, distinct and independent growths;
and by 1690 the epithets North and South were
commonly used.</p>

<div id="Philip_Ludwell" class="sidenote">Philip Ludwell.</div>

<p>Just at this time, however, the two were united
under one governor. Colonel Philip Ludwell, of
Virginia, who had ably supported Berkeley
against Bacon, and had afterward
married Berkeley’s widow, was Sothel’s successor
in Albemarle in 1689, and he was appointed to
succeed him at Charleston in 1691. The proprietors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
wished to bring all Carolina under one government,
and the Albemarle people were requested
to send their representatives to the assembly at
Charleston, but distance made such a scheme impracticable.
The northern colony, however, was
often governed by a deputy appointed at Charleston.
The troubles were not yet over. Ludwell
was an upright and able man, but the disagreements
between the settlers and the lords proprietors
were more than he could cope with, and in
1692 he was superseded.</p>

<p>It is not worth while to recount the names of all
the men who served as governors in the two Carolinas.
In the world of history there is a certain
amount of meaningless mediocrity which a general
survey like the present may well pass
by without notice. The brief administration
of John Archdale, in 1695, marks a kind
of era. Archdale was a Quaker, a man of broad
intelligence and character at once strong and
gentle. He had become one of the lords proprietors,
and in that capacity came out to Carolina,
where for one year he ruled the whole province
with such authority as no one had wielded before;
for while he was backed up by the proprietors, he
conciliated the assemblies. In the matter of the
Indians and the quit-rents much was done, and the
veto power of the proprietors was curtailed. After
a year Archdale felt able to go home, leaving his
friend Joseph Blake, a nephew of the
great admiral, as governor in Charleston.
Under Blake still further progress was made by
admitting to full political rights and privileges the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
Huguenot immigrants, who had come to be in some
respects the most important element in the population
of South Carolina. But after Blake’s death,
in 1700, it grew stormy again. The new governor,
James Moore, came out to make money, and to
that end he renewed the vile practice of kidnapping
Indians. This presently made it necessary
to gather troops and defeat the angry red men.
Quarrels with the assembly were chronic. When
the war of the Spanish Succession broke out,
Moore invaded Florida, but accomplished nothing
except the creation of a heavy public debt. In
1703 he was superseded by Sir Nathaniel
Johnson, a precious bigot, who undertook
to force through the assembly a law excluding
from it all Dissenters. This was effected
by trickery; the act was passed by a majority of
one, in a house from which several members were
absent. After the fraud was discovered, the assembly
by a large majority voted to repeal the act,
but the governor refused to sign the repeal. The
Dissenters were perhaps three fourths of the population.
They made complaint to the lords proprietors,
but a majority of that body sustained the
governor. Then a successful appeal was made to
the House of Lords, and the proprietors suddenly
found themselves threatened with the loss of their
charter. The result was a great victory for the
South Carolina assembly, which at its next session
restored Dissenters to their full privileges.</p>

<div id="Unsuccessful_attempt_of_a_French_and_Spanish_fleet_upon_Charleston" class="sidenote">Unsuccessful attempt of a French and
Spanish fleet upon Charleston.</div>

<p>Like many another bigot, Governor Johnson
was a good fighter. In August, 1706, Charleston
was attacked by a French and Spanish squadron.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
A visitation of yellow fever, with half a dozen
deaths daily in a population of 3,000,
had frightened many people away from
the town. On a broiling Saturday afternoon
five columns of smoke floating
lazily up over Sullivan’s Island announced that
five warships were descried in the offing. They
were French privateers with Spanish reinforcements
from Cuba and St. Augustine. When the
signal was reported to the governor at his country
house, the militia were called together from all
quarters and the ships in the harbour were quickly
made ready for action. The evening air was vocal
with alarm guns. But the enemy approached with
such excessive caution that Johnson had ample
time for preparation. It was not until Wednesday
that the affair matured. Then the French commander
sent a flag of truce ashore and demanded,
in the name of Louis XIV., the surrender of the
town and its inhabitants; the governor, he said,
might have an hour to consider his answer. Johnson
replied that he did not need a minute, and told
the Frenchman to go to the devil. The enemy
then landed 150 men on the north shore of the
harbour, at Haddrell’s Beacon, but the militia soon
drove them into the water, with the loss of a dozen
killed and more than thirty prisoners. Many more
were drowned in swimming to their boats. Another
detachment on the south shore was similarly
discomfited. On Thursday Colonel William Rhett,
with six small craft heavily armed and a fire-ship,
bore down upon the enemy’s fleet. But instead of
waiting to fight, the French commander hastily
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
stood out to sea. This conduct, as well as his
whole delay, may be explained by the fact that
an important part of his force had not come up.
The best of the French ships, carrying beside her
marine force some 200 regular infantry, did not
arrive until Friday, when, in ignorance of the
repulse of her consorts, she entered Sewee Bay
and landed her soldiers. It was rushing into the
lion’s jaws. The soldiers were promptly attacked
and put to flight with the loss of one third of their
number, while at the same time Colonel Rhett
blockaded the bay and took the French ship with
all on board. Thus the ill-concerted attack ended
in ignominious defeat, with the loss of the best
ship and 300 men out of 800.</p>

<p>After the halcyon days of Archdale there was
quiet in North Carolina until 1704, when Governor
Johnson sent a deputy, Robert Daniel, to
rule there and set up the Church of England,
while making it hot for Dissenters. As nearly all
the Albemarle people came within the latter category,
there was trouble at once. It was allayed
for a moment by the same proceedings in England
which gave victory to the Dissenters of South Carolina.
The Quakers of Albemarle succeeded
in getting Johnson to appoint a
new deputy, Thomas Carey, in whom
they had confidence. But their confidence
proved to have been misplaced. A recent
act of Queen Anne’s Parliament had prescribed
certain test oaths for all public officials, without
making any reservation in behalf of the conscientious
scruples of Quakers. Carey, as deputy
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
governor of North Carolina, undertook to administer
these test oaths, and at once disgusted the
Quakers, who sent John Porter to England to
plead with the lords proprietors. This
Porter, who was himself a Quaker, had a
persuasive tongue. Acts of Parliament
had not usually been heeded by the colonies; it
was by no means clear that they were even intended
to apply to the colonies without some
declaratory clause to that effect, or without being
supplemented by a royal order in council. The
lords proprietors virtually admitted that the Queen
Anne test oath act did not apply to the colonies,
when in response to Porter’s petition they removed
Carey from office. At the same time they suspended
Governor Johnson’s authority over North
Carolina. This action left that colony without a
head, and there ought to have been no delay in
appointing a new governor, but there was delay.
On Porter’s return William Glover was chosen
president of the council, which made him temporary
governor. Glover belonged to the Church
of England, but was believed to be opposed to
the test oaths. We can fancy, then, the wrath
of the Quakers when he insisted upon administering
the oaths, precisely as the deposed Carey
had done! The remedy was an instance of political
homœopathy, or treatment with a hair of
the dog that bit you. The angry Porter
at once turned to Carey and entered
into an alliance with him from which
dire evils were to grow. Porter contrived to assemble
various resident deputies of the lords proprietors,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
and persuaded them to depose Glover
and reinstate Carey; but Glover refused to be
bound by these irregular proceedings. He continued
to act as governor and issued writs for the
election of an assembly; Carey did likewise, and
anarchy reigned supreme. Several of the principal
colonists fled to Virginia for safety. In 1710,
after a delay of more than three years, the proprietors
sent out Edward Hyde, a kinsman
if the queen’s grandfather, the first Earl
of Clarendon, to govern North Carolina. His commission
needed the signature of the governor-in-chief
at Charleston, but that dignitary happened
to die just before Hyde’s arrival, so that further
delay was entailed in completing his commission.
Early in 1711, before receiving it, he issued writs
for an election. Carey made strenuous efforts to
secure the election of a majority of his friends and
adherents to the Commons House of Assembly, or
House of Commons, as it came to be called. Failing
in this attempt he maintained that the election
was illegal because Hyde had not received his
vouchers. The assembly retorted by summoning
Carey to render an account of all the public
moneys which he had used, and presently it issued
orders for his arrest. Thus driven to bay, Carey
set up a rival government and tried to
arrest Hyde, who appealed to Virginia
for military aid. Virginia’s response was prompt
and effective. The discomfited Carey fled to the
wilderness between the heads of Albemarle and
Pamlico sounds. After a while he ventured into
Virginia, intending to take passage there for England;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
but he was arrested and sent to England to
be tried for treason. For lack of accessible evidence
he seems to have been released without trial,
and thereupon he made his way to the West Indies,
where history loses sight of him. With his disappearance
from North Carolina tranquillity seemed
for the moment restored; but more terrible scenes
were at hand.</p>

of Graffenried.</div>

<div id="Accusations_against_Carey_and_Porter" class="sidenote">Improbable charges against Carey and
Porter.</div>

<p>In spite of all the turmoil the little colony
had received new settlers, and had begun to expand
until North Carolina was no longer synonymous
with Albemarle. In the first decade of the
eighteenth century, numbers of Huguenots settled
in the neighbourhood of Bath, where the Taw
River widens into an arm of Pamlico
Sound; and parties of Swiss, with many
Germans from the Rhenish Palatinate,
under the lead of Baron de Graffenried,
founded the town of New Berne, where the Trent
River flows into the Neuse. The increase of
population in Albemarle, moreover, had carried
the frontier from the Chowan to the Roanoke.
All this entailed some real and still more prospective
displacement of native tribes, and some
kind of mild remonstrance, after the well-known
Indian fashion, was to be expected. It was believed
by many persons at the time that Carey, on
the occasion of his flight to the wilderness
between the Roanoke and Taw
rivers, solicited aid from the Indians,
and that his Quaker friend, John Porter,
had gone as emissary to the Tuscaroras, “promising
great rewards to incite them to cut off all
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
the inhabitants of that part of Carolina that
adhered to Mr. Hyde.”<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> But a charge of such
frightful character needs strong evidence to make
it credible, and in this case there is little but
hearsay and the vague beliefs of men hostile to
Carey and Porter, in a season of fierce political
excitement. No such infernal wickedness is
needed to account for the Indian outbreak. The
ordinary incidents connected with the advance of
the white man’s frontier into the red man’s country
are quite sufficient to explain it. But, without
feeling it necessary to accuse Carey and Porter of
having urged the Indians to murder their fellow-countrymen,
we must still admit that the civil
discord into which they had plunged the colony
had so weakened it as to offer the watchful red
men an excellent opportunity.</p>

<p>The Indians of North Carolina at the time
which we are treating belonged to three ethnic
families. Along the coast, northward
from Cape Lookout to the Virginia
line, the Corees, Pamlicos, Mattamuskeets,
Pasquotanks, and Chowanoes all belonged
to the Algonquin family, and they could muster
in all about 400 warriors. The coast territory
occupied by these tribes was continuous with that
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
which had once been controlled by the Powhatan
Confederacy to the northward. The Corees, in
Carteret Precinct, were the southernmost of these
Algonquin tribes. The Cape Fear Indians, on the
coast southwest of Carteret, belonged to the great
Sioux or Dakota family. From the meridian of
77° 30´ westward to the Blue Ridge, and from the
Santee River on the south to the Potomac on
the north, the country was occupied by
Sioux tribes, of which the names most
familiarly known are the Waxhaws, Catawbas,
Waterees, Saponis and Tutelos, Monacans and
Manahoacs.<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> Now deep into this Sioux country,
in North Carolina, there ran a powerful wedge of
alien stock. The thick end of the wedge covered
the precincts of Bath and Craven, with part
of New Hanover; and from its centre, at the
mouth of Trent River, it ran northwestward more
than a hundred miles, a little beyond the site of
Raleigh, with an average width of less than thirty
miles. This wedge of population consisted
of the Tuscaroras, a large tribe
of the dreaded Iroquois family, able to send forth
at least 1,200 warriors. Another tribe of Iroquois
then dwelt in Bertie Precinct, between the
Chowan and Roanoke rivers. It was known as
the Meherrins, and was really the remnant of the
fierce Susquehannocks, from whom Bacon had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
delivered Virginia in 1676. Its fighting numbers
can hardly have been much over a hundred. Just
north of the Meherrins was another small Iroquois
tribe called Nottoways. To frame our picture,
although it takes us away from the scene of action,
we should add that the whole Alpine region west
of the Sioux country, from the Peaks of Otter as
far southwest as Lookout and Chickamauga mountains,
belonged to the great Iroquois tribe of
Cherokees; while to the south of Santee River,
from Florida to the Mississippi River,
we encounter a fourth ethnic family, the
Muskogi, represented by such tribes as Choctaws
and Chickasaws, the Creek Confederacy, the Yamassees,
and others.</p>

<div id="Algonquin_Iroquois_conspiracy" class="sidenote">Algonquin-Iroquois conspiracy.</div>

<p>Between the Tuscaroras and the numerous Sioux
tribes by which they were partly surrounded there
was incessant and murderous hostility. On the
other hand, there was amity and alliance, at least
for the moment, between the Tuscaroras and the
Algonquin coast tribes whose lands the palefaces
were invading. The first murders of white settlers
occurred in Bertie Precinct at the hands of Meherrins,
and seem to have been isolated
cases. But a general conspiracy of Iroquois
and Algonquin tribes was not long
in forming, and the day before the new moon,
September 22, 1711, was appointed for a wholesale
massacre.</p>

<div id="Capture_of_Graffenried_and_Lawson" class="sidenote">Capture of Graffenried and Lawson.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Lawson’s horrible death.</div>

<p>A few days before the appointed time the Baron
de Graffenried started in his pinnace from New
Berne to explore the Neuse River. His only companions
were a negro servant and John Lawson, a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
Scotchman who for a dozen years had been surveyor-general
of the colony. Lawson was the author
of an extremely valuable and fascinating book
on Carolina and its native races,&mdash;a book which
one cannot read without loving the writer and
mourning his melancholy fate.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> No man
in the colony was better known by the Indians,
who had frequently observed and
carefully noted the fact that his appearance in the
woods with his surveying instruments was apt to be
followed by some fresh encroachment upon their
lands. Lawson and Graffenried had advanced but
little way into the Tuscarora wilderness when they
were surrounded by a host of Indians and taken
prisoners. The Indians were very curious to learn
why they had come up the river; perhaps it might
indicate that the people at New Berne had some
suspicion of the intended massacre and had sent
them forward as scouts. If any such dread beset
the minds of the red men, it was probably soon
allayed; for it is clear that, had there been any
suspicion, Graffenried and Lawson would not thus
have ventured out of all reach of support. The
barbarians were two or three days in making up
their minds what to do. Then they took
poor Lawson, and thrust into his skin
all over, from head to foot, sharp splinters
of lightwood, almost dripping with its own turpentine,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
and set him afire.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> The negro was also put
to death with fiendish torments, but Graffenried
was kept a prisoner, perhaps in order to be burned
on some festal occasion.</p>

1712.</div>

<p>Before the news of this dreadful affair could
reach New Berne, the blow had fallen, not only
there, but also at Bath and on the Roanoke River.
Some hundreds of settlers were massacred,&mdash;at
New Berne 130 within two hours from the signal.
No circumstance of horror was wanting. Men
were gashed and scorched, children torn in pieces,
women impaled on stakes. The slaughter
went on for three days. A war-chief
called by the white men Handcock seems
to have been the leading spirit in this concerted
attack, but as usual in Indian warfare the concert
was incomplete.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> An outlying detachment of Tuscaroras
in Bertie Precinct, whose head war-chief
was called Tom Blunt, took no part in
the massacre and remained on good terms
with the whites. Perhaps Blunt’s attitude
may have been affected by nearness to Virginia
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
and its able governor, Alexander Spotswood,
who was certainly instrumental in keeping the Nottoways
and Meherrins quiet. Through Blunt’s
intervention, Spotswood secured the release of
Graffenried, after five weeks of captivity, and it
was not the fault of this valiant governor that Virginia
troops did not march against Handcock; for
his House of Burgesses, after advising such a
measure, behaved like a “whimsical multitude,”
and refused to vote the necessary funds.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> Important
aid, however, was obtained from South Carolina,
which had for the moment a more complaisant
assembly, and in Charles Craven a wise and able
governor. Advantage was taken of the deadly
hatred which the Sioux and Muskogi tribes bore
to the Iroquois. With a small body of white men,
supported by large numbers of Muskogi Creeks
and Yamassees, and of Sioux Catawbas, Colonel
John Barnwell made a long and arduous winter
march through more than 250 miles of
virgin forest to the Neuse River, where
he encountered the Tuscaroras, and in an
obstinate battle defeated them with the loss of 400
warriors. Then Handcock, retiring behind a stockade,
sought and obtained terms from Barnwell; a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
treaty was made, and the South Carolina forces
went home.</p>

<p>They had scarcely departed when the faithless
red men renewed their bloody work, and in March
the distracted colony was again obliged to ask for
succour. Summer added to the other horrors the
scourge of yellow fever, which carried off some
hundreds of victims, among them Governor Hyde.
In December a force of 50 white men and 1,000
Indians from South Carolina, under Colonel James
Moore, arrived on the scene, and in March, 1713,
Handcock was driven to cover on the site of the
present town of Snow Hill, in Greene County.
His palisaded fort was stormed with great
slaughter, and that was the end of the
Indian power in eastern North Carolina.
Their remnant of defeated Tuscaroras
withdrew to the upper waters of the Roanoke, and
thence migrated northward to central New York,
where they were admitted into the great confederacy
of their kinsmen, the Iroquois of the Long
House. Thus did the celebrated Five Nations
become the Six Nations.</p>

<div id="Charles_Eden" class="sidenote">Charles

<p>After Hyde’s death the government was ably
administered by one of the leading colonists,
Thomas Pollock, as president of the council. In
1714 Charles Eden came out as governor. Under
the stress of war the colony had begun to issue
paper money, a curse from which it was destined
long to suffer. But some other evils were remedied.
Liberty of conscience was secured
to Dissenters, and in the matter of test
oaths the Quaker’s affirmation was accepted as an
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
equivalent. Eden was a very popular governor
and managed affairs with ability until his death in
1722. His name is preserved in that of the town
of Edenton, in Chowan County, which was in his
time the seat of government.</p>

<div id="Yamassees_and_the_Spaniards" class="sidenote">The Yamassees and the Spaniards.</div>

<p>We must now turn to South Carolina, where we
have seen Governor Craven using the Yamassee
and Catawba warriors as allies to be sent against
the Tuscaroras. The year 1713, which witnessed
the crushing defeat of the Tuscaroras, was the year
of the treaty of Utrecht, which ended the long war
of the Spanish Succession. Throughout that war
the powerful tribe of Yamassees had been steadfast
friends of the English. From time
to time they made incursions into Florida
and brought away many a Spanish captive
to be burned alive, until government checked
their cruelty by offering a ransom for Spanish
prisoners delivered in safety at Charleston; the
prisoners were then sent home on payment of the
amount of their ransom by the government at St.
Augustine.</p>

<div id="Alliance_of_Indian_tribes" class="sidenote">Alliance of Indian tribes against the South
Carolinians.</div>

<div class="sidenote">The Indian war.</div>

<p>The Yamassee country was the last quarter from
which the South Carolinians would have expected
hostilities to come. But after 1713, in spite of
treaty obligations, the St. Augustine government
bent all its energies to stirring up all the frontier
tribes to a concerted attack upon the English.
Bribes in the shape of gaudy coats, steel hatchets,
and firearms were distributed among the chiefs;
the solemn palavers, the banquets of boiled dog,
the exchanges of wampum belts, the puffing of red
clay pipes, the beastly orgies of fire-water, may be
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
left to our imagination, for we have no such minute
chroniclers here as the Jesuits of
Canada. The outcome of it all was a
grand conspiracy of Yamassees, Creeks,
Catawbas, and Cherokees, with other less
important tribes, comprising perhaps 7,000 or
8,000 warriors, against the colony of South Carolina.
But, as in all such plans for concerted
action among Indians, the concert was very imperfect.
Hostilities began in April, 1715,
with the massacre of ninety persons at
Pocotaligo, and lasted until February, 1716, by
which time 400 Christians had lost their lives;
while the red men were thoroughly vanquished,
and the shattered remnant of the Yamassees sought
shelter in Florida.</p>

with great ability and courage, was a man of high
character, and when he returned to England in
1717 his departure was mourned. His successor,
Robert Johnson, was son of Sir Nathaniel Johnson,
who had formerly been governor. The younger
Johnson, an able and popular official, was
the last governor of South Carolina under
the lords proprietors. His romantic experiences
in dealing with pirates will be recounted in my
next chapter. The chain of events which brought
about a political revolution in 1719 admits of brief
description. The Indian war had laden South
Carolina with debt, and it was felt that the lords
proprietors ought to contribute something toward
relieving the distress of a colony which had yielded
them a princely income. But the lords proprietors
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
did not take this view of the case. As a means of
discharging the public debt, the assembly laid a
revenue tariff upon imports, but the lords proprietors
vetoed it. The assembly proposed to raise
money by selling Yamassee lands to settlers, but
the lords proprietors laid claim to the conquered
territory for their own use and behoof. Thus the
situation was fast becoming unendurable.</p>

Carolina.</div>

<p>In December, 1718, war broke out again between
Spain and England. The Spaniards planned an
expedition against Charleston, and Johnson
asked the assembly for money. They
proposed to raise it by collecting revenue
under the tariff act, in disregard of the veto.
Nicholas Trott, the chief justice, declared that this
would not do; the courts would uphold delinquents
who should refuse to pay. The assembly denied
the right of the proprietors to veto their acts. The
members consulted their constituents and were sustained
by them. Finally the assembly resolved
itself into a revolutionary convention, deposed the
lords proprietors, and offered the governorship to
Johnson as royal governor. On his refusal to take
part in such proceedings, the convention chose for
provisional royal governor Colonel James Moore,
the hero of the Tuscarora war. Johnson’s only reliance,
in such an emergency, was the militia; but
the militia deserted him and went over to the convention,
and thus, in December, 1719, the popular
revolution was complete. When the news reached
London, the course of the assembly was approved
by the crown, the proprietary charter was declared
to be forfeited, and our old friend Sir Francis
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
Nicholson was sent out to South Carolina as royal
governor.</p>

<div class="sidenote">End of the
proprietary
government.</div>

<p>Three years later there was renewal of civil discord
in North Carolina, after the death of Governor
Eden and the arrival of his successor, George Burrington,
a vulgar ruffian who had served a term in
prison for an infamous assault upon an old woman.
Five years of turmoil, with changes of governors,
followed. In 1728 Parliament requested the king
to buy Carolina, and appropriated money for the
purpose. The proprietors were Henry
Somerset, Duke of Beaufort, and his
brother, Lord Charles Somerset; Lord
Craven; Lord Carteret; John Cotton; the heirs
of Sir John Colleton; James and Henry Bertie;
Mary Dawson and Elizabeth Moore. Lord Carteret
would not sell his share. All the others
consented to sell for a modest sum total scarcely
amounting to £50,000; and so in 1729 the many-headed
palatinate founded by Charles II. came to
an end, and in its place were the two royal provinces
of North and South Carolina.</p>

<div id="Contrasts_between_the_two_Carolinas" class="sidenote">Contrasts
between the
two Carolinas.</div>

<p>The careers of the two southern colonies whose
beginnings we have thus sketched were very different,
and between their respective social characteristics
the contrasts were so great that
it is impossible to make general statements
applicable alike to the two. In
one respect the contrast was different from that
which one would observe in comparing Virginia
with New England. In New England a marked
concentration of social life in towns and villages
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
co-existed with complete democracy, while in
Virginia the isolated life upon great plantations
was connected with an aristocratic structure
of society. But between the two Carolinas the
contrast was just the reverse of this. Of all the
southern colonies, North Carolina was the one in
which society was the most scattered, and town
life the least developed, while it was also the one
in which the general aspect of society was the
least aristocratic. On the other hand, in South
Carolina there was a peculiarly strong concentration
of social life into a single focus in Charleston;
and in connection with this we find a type of
society in some respects more essentially aristocratic
than in Virginia. We shall find it worth
our while to dwell for a moment upon some of the
immediate causes of these differences.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Effects of geographical conditions.</div>

<div id="North_Carolina_contrasted" class="sidenote">Interior of North Carolina contrasted with
the coast.</div>

<p>The history of North America affords an interesting
illustration of the way in which the character
of a community may be determined for good
or ill by geographical circumstances. There have
been historians and philosophers unable
to see anything except such physical
conditions at work in determining the
course of human affairs. With such views I
have small sympathy,<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> but it would be idle to deny
that physical conditions are very important, and
the study of them is highly instructive. But for
the peculiar physical conformation of its coast,
North Carolina, rather than Virginia, would
doubtless have been the first American state. It
was upon Roanoke Island that the earliest attempts
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
were made, but Ralph Lane in 1585
already came to the conclusion that the Chesapeake
region would afford better opportunities.
First and foremost, the harbourage was spoiled by
the prevalent sand-bars. Then huge pine barrens
near the coast hindered the first efforts of the
planter, and extensive malarial swamps imperilled
his life.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a> The first attempts at cultivation increased
the danger, which was of a kind
that would yield only to modern methods
of drainage. It was only by the
coast that the conditions were thus forbidding.
No American state has greater natural
advantages than North Carolina. For diversity of
eligible soils, for salubrity of climate, for variety
of flora and fauna, she is unsurpassed; while for
beauty and grandeur of scenery she may well claim
to be first among the states east of the Rocky
Mountains.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> John Lawson describes North Carolina
with enthusiasm as “a delicious country, being
placed in that girdle of the world which affords
wine, oil, fruit, grain, and silk, with other rich commodities,
besides a sweet air, moderate climate, and
fertile soil. These are the blessings, under Heaven’s
protection, that spin out the thread of life to its
utmost extent, and crown our days with the sweets
of health and plenty, which, when joined with content,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
render the possessors the happiest race of men
upon earth.”<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a> The good Lawson, who was somewhat
inclined to see things in rose-colour, praised
even the gentleness of the Indians, who (as we
have seen) returned the compliment after their
manner, by roasting him alive. But, with all this
beauty and richness of the interior country, the
obstacles presented at the coast turned the first
great wave of English colonization into Virginia;
and thereafter the settlement of North Carolina was
determined largely, and by no means to its advantage,
by the social conditions of the older colony.</p>

<div id="Unkempt_life" class="sidenote">Unkempt
life.</div>

<p>In its early days North Carolina was simply a
portion of Virginia’s frontier; and to this wild
frontier the shiftless people who could not make a
place for themselves in Virginia society, including
many of the “mean whites,” flocked in large numbers.
In their new home they soon acquired the
reputation of being very lawless in temper, holding
it to be the chief end of man to resist all
constituted authority, and above all things to pay
no taxes. In some respects, as in the administration
of justice, one might have witnessed such
scenes as continued for generations to characterize
American frontier life. The courts sat
oftentimes in taverns, where the tedium
of business was relieved by glasses of grog, while
the judge’s decisions were not put on record, but
were simply shouted by the crier from the inn
door or at the nearest market-place. It was not
until 1703 that a clergyman was settled in the
colony, though there were Quaker meetings before
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
that time. As late as 1729 Colonel Byrd writes
of Edenton, the seat of government: “I believe
this is the only metropolis in the Christian or Mohammedan
world where there is neither church,
chapel, mosque, synagogue, or any other place of
public worship, of any sect or religion whatsoever.”
In this country “they pay no tribute, either to
God or to Cæsar.”<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a></p>

<div id="genre_picture_by_Colonel_Byrd" class="sidenote">A genre
picture by
Colonel
Byrd.</div>

<p>According to Colonel Byrd, these people were
chargeable with laziness, but more especially the
men, who let their wives work for them. The men,
he says, “make their wives rise out of
their beds early in the morning, at the
same time that they lie and snore till the
sun has run one third of his course and dispersed
all the unwholesome damps. Then, after stretching
and yawning for half an hour, they light their
pipes, and under the protection of a cloud of smoke
venture out into the open air; though, if it happens
to be never so little cold, they quickly return
shivering into the chimney corner. When the
weather is mild, they stand leaning with both their
arms upon the cornfield fence, and gravely consider
whether they had best go and take a small
heat at the hoe, but generally find reasons to put
it off until another time. Thus they loiter away
their lives, like Solomon’s sluggard, with their
arms across, and at the winding up of the year
scarcely have bread to eat.”<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a> Every one has met
with the type of man here described. In Massachusetts
to-day you may find sporadic examples of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
him in decaying mountain villages, left high and
dry by the railroads that follow the winding valleys;
or now and then you may find him clustered
in some tiny hamlet of crazy shanties nestling in a
secluded area of what Mr. Ricardo would have
called “the worst land under cultivation,” and bearing
some such pithy local name as “Hardscrabble”
or “Satan’s Kingdom.” Such men do not make
the strength of Massachusetts, or of any commonwealth.
They did not make the strength of North
Carolina, and it should not be forgotten that Byrd’s
testimony is that of an unfriendly or at least a
satirical observer. Nevertheless there is strong
reason for believing that his portrait is one for
which the old Albemarle colony could have furnished
many sitters. Such people were sure to be
drawn thither by the legislation which made the
colony an Alsatia for insolvent debtors.</p>

<div id="Industries_of_North_Carolina" class="sidenote">Industries.</div>

<p>The industries of North Carolina in the early
times were purely agricultural. There were no
manufactures. The simplest and commonest articles
of daily use were imported from the northern
colonies or from England. Agriculture was conducted
more wastefully and with less intelligence
than in any of the other colonies. In the northern
counties tobacco was almost exclusively cultivated.
In the Cape Fear region there were flourishing rice-fields.
A great deal of excellent timber was cut;
in particular the yellow pine of North Carolina
was then, as now, famous for its hardness and
durability. Tar and turpentine were also
produced in large quantities. All this
furnished the basis for a flourishing foreign commerce;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
but the people did not take kindly to the
sea, and the carrying trade was monopolized by
New Englanders. The fisheries, which were of
considerable value, were altogether neglected. All
business or traffic about the coast was carried on
under perilous conditions; for pirates were always
hovering about, secure in the sympathy of many of
the people, like the brigands of southern Italy in
recent times.</p>

<div id="Absence_of_towns" class="sidenote">Absence of towns.</div>

<p>In the absence of manufactures, and with commerce
so little developed, there was no town life.
Byrd describes Edenton as containing forty or fifty
houses, small and cheaply built: “a citizen here is
counted extravagant if he has ambition enough to
aspire to a brick chimney.”<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> As late as 1776 New
Berne and Wilmington were villages of five or six
hundred inhabitants each. Not only were there no
towns, but there were very few large plantations
with stately manor houses like those of
Virginia. A great part of the country
was covered with its primeval forest, in which
thousands of hogs, branded with their owners’
marks, wandered and rooted until the time came
for hunting them out and slaughtering them.
Where rude clearings had been made in the wilderness
there were small, ill-kept farms. Nearly
all the people were small farmers, whose work
was done chiefly by black slaves or by white servants.
The treatment of the slaves is said to
have been usually mild, as in Virginia. The white
servants fared better, and the general state of society
was so low that when their time of service
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
was ended they had here a good chance of rising
to a position of equality with their masters. The
country swarmed with ruffians of all sorts, who
fled thither from South Carolina and Virginia;
life and property were insecure, and Lynch law
was not unfrequently administered. The small
planters were apt to be hard drinkers, and among
their social amusements were scrimmages, in which
noses were sometimes broken and eyes gouged out.
There was a great deal of gambling. But, except
at elections and other meetings for political purposes,
people saw very little of each other. The
isolation of homesteads, which prevailed over the
South, reached its maximum in North Carolina.
It is not strange, then, that the colony was a century
old before it could boast of a printing-press,
or that there were no schools until shortly before
the war for Independence. A mail from Virginia
came some eight or ten times in a year, but it only
reached a few towns on the coast, and down to the
time of the Revolution the interior of the country
had no mails at all.</p>

of

<div id="Spotswoods_account_of_the_matter" class="sidenote">Spotswood’s
account of

<p>All these consequences clearly followed from the
character of the emigration by which North Carolina
was first peopled, and that character was
determined by its geographical position as a wilderness
frontier to such a commonwealth as Virginia.
In the character of this emigration we find the
reasons for the comparatively democratic state
of society. As there were so few large
plantations and wealthy planters, while
nearly all the white people were small land-owners,
and as the highest class was thus so much lower in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
dignity than the corresponding class in Virginia, it
became just so much the easier for the “mean
whites” to rise far enough to become a part of it.
North Carolina, therefore, was not simply an Alsatia
for debtors and criminals, but it afforded a home
for the better portion of Virginia’s poor people.
We can thus see how there would come about a
natural segregation of Virginia’s white freedmen
into four classes: 1. The most enterprising and
thrifty would succeed in maintaining a respectable
existence in Virginia; 2. A much larger class, less
thrifty and enterprising, would find it easier to
make a place for themselves in the ruder society
of North Carolina; 3. A lower stratum
would consist of persons without enterprise
or thrift who remained in Virginia
to recruit the ranks of “white trash;”
4. The lowest stratum would comprise the outlaws
who fled into North Carolina to escape the hangman.
Of the third class the eighteenth century
seems to have witnessed a gradual exodus from
Virginia, so that in 1773 it was possible for the
traveller, John Ferdinand Smyth, to declare that
there were fewer cases of poverty in proportion to
the population than anywhere else “in the universe.”
The statement of Bishop Meade in 1857,
which was quoted in the preceding chapter,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> shows
that the class of “mean whites” had not even then
become extinct in Virginia; but it is clear that the
slow but steady exodus had been such as greatly to
diminish its numbers and its importance as a social
feature. Some of these freedmen went northward
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
into Pennsylvania,<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> but most of them sought the
western and southern frontiers, and at first the
southern frontier was a far more eligible retreat
than the western. Of this outward movement of
white freedmen the governor of Virginia wrote in
1717: “The Inhabitants of our ffrontiers are composed
generally of such as have been transported
hither as Servants, and being out of their time,
... settle themselves where Land is to be taken
up ... that will produce the necessarys of Life
with little Labour. It is pretty well known what
Morals such people bring with them hither, which
are not like to be much mended by their Scituation,
remote from all places of worship; they
are so little concerned about Religion,
that the Children of many of the Inhabitants
of those ffrontier Settlements are 20, and
some 30 years of age before they are baptized, and
some not at all.... These people, knowing the
Indians to be lovers of strong liquors, make no
scruple of first making them drunk and then cheating
them of their skins; on the other hand, the
Indians, being unacquainted with the methods of
obtaining reparation by Law, frequently revenged
themselves by the murder of the persons who thus
treated them, or (according to their notions of Satisfaction)
of the next Englishman they could most
easily cutt off.”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a> In this description we may recognize
some features of frontier life in recent
times.

<div id="The_German_immigration" class="sidenote">The German immigration.</div>

<div id="Scotch_Highlanders_and_Scotch_Irish" class="sidenote">The Scotch-Irish immigration.</div>

<p>We have hitherto considered only the earliest
period of North Carolina history. From about
1720 marked changes began to be visible. There
was such a change in the character of the immigration
as by and by to result in more or less displacement
of population. Since the barbarous
devastation of the Rhenish Palatinate by French
troops in 1688-93 there had been much distress
among those worthy Germans, and after a while
they sought to mend their fortunes by coming to
America. This migration continued for
many years. Some of these Germans
settled in the Mohawk valley, where their
mark was placed upon the map in such town names
as Minden, Frankfort, and Oppenheim, and where
they contributed to our Revolutionary War one of
its most picturesque figures in Nicholas Herkimer.
A great many came to the Susquehanna valley in
what was then the western part of Pennsylvania,
where their descendants still speak and write that
sweet old-fashioned language which we ought hardly
to call Pennsylvania <i>Dutch</i>, since it is a dialect of
High German besprinkled with English. From
Pennsylvania large numbers followed the valleys
between the Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies and
made their way as far as South Carolina. We
have already noted the arrival of Germans, Swiss,
and Huguenots on the North Carolina seaboard
early in the century. Later on, in 1745, after the
suppression of the Jacobite rebellion, there came
to North Carolina a powerful reinforcement of
Scotch Highlanders, among them many of the clan
Macdonald, including the romantic Flora Macdonald,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
who had done so much for the young fugitive
prince. But more important and far more
numerous than all the other elements in the population
were the Scotch-Irish from Ulster, who&mdash;goaded
by unwise and unjust laws&mdash;began coming
in large numbers about 1719, and have played a
much greater and more extensive part in American
history than has yet been recognized. There was
hardly one of the thirteen colonies upon which
these Scotch-Irish did not leave their
mark. To the story of their coming I
shall revert in my concluding chapter,
where it forms the most important part of the
story of the westward advance of Virginia. For
the present it may suffice to point out that in North
Carolina they had come, before the Revolutionary
War, to be the strongest element in the population
of the colony. Under the influence of these various
and excellent streams of immigration, the character
of the colony was gradually but effectively
altered. Industry and thrift came to prevail in
the wilderness, and various earnest Puritanic types
of religion flourished side by side on friendly
terms.</p>

<div id="Further_dispersal_of_poor_whites" class="sidenote">Displacement
and
further dispersal
of
poor whites.</div>

<p>As society in North Carolina became more and
more orderly and civilized, the old mean white element,
or at least the more intractable part of it, was
gradually pushed out to the westward.
This stream that had started from Old
Virginia flowed for a while southwestward
into the South Carolina back-country.
But the southerly movement was gradually turned
more and more to the westward.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span></p>

<div class="sidenote">“Crackers,”
etc.</div>

<p>Always clinging to the half-savage frontier, these
poor white people made their way from North
Carolina westward through Tennessee, and their
descendants may still be found here and there in
Arkansas, southern Missouri, and what is sometimes
known as the Egyptian extremity of Illinois.
From the South Carolina back-country, through
Georgia, they were scattered here and there among
the states on the Gulf of Mexico. Taken at its
worst, this type of American citizen is portrayed
in Martin Chuzzlewit’s unwelcome visitor, the redoubtable
Hannibal Chollop. Specimens of him
might have been found among the border ruffians
led by the savage Quantrell in 1863 to the cruel
massacre at Lawrence, and among the desperadoes
whose dark deeds used forty years ago to give such
cities as Memphis an unenviable prominence in the
pages of the “Police Gazette.” But in the average
specimens of the type one would find not
criminality of disposition so much as shiftlessness.
Of the stunted, gaunt, and cadaverous “sand-hillers”
of South Carolina and Georgia, a keen
observer says that “they are incapable
of applying themselves steadily to any
labour, and their habits are very much like those
of the old Indians.”<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> The “clay-eaters,” who are
said to sustain life on crude whiskey and aluminous
earth, are doubtless of similar type, as well
as the “conches,” “crackers,” and “corn-crackers”
of various Southern states. All these seem
to represent a degraded variety or strain of the
English race. Concerning the origin of this degraded
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
strain, detailed documentary evidence is
not easy to get; but the facts of its distribution
furnish data for valid inferences such as the naturalist
entertains concerning the origin and migrations
of some species of animal or plant.</p>

<p id="Barbarizing_effects_of_isolation">There is, <i>first</i>, the importation of degraded English
humanity in large numbers to the two oldest
colonies in which there is a demand for wholesale
cheap labour; <i>secondly</i>, the substitution of black
cheap labour for white; <i>thirdly</i>, the tendency of
the degraded white humanity to seek the frontier,
as described by Spotswood, or else to lodge in
sequestered nooks outside of the main currents of
progress. These data are sufficient in general to
explain the origin and distribution of the “crackers,”
but a word of qualification is needed. It is
not to be supposed that the ancestors of all the
persons designated as “crackers” were once white
freedmen in Virginia and Maryland; it is more
probable that this class furnished a nucleus about
which various wrecks of decayed and broken-down
humanity from many quarters were gradually
gathered. Nor are we bound to suppose that
every community of ignorant, semi-civilized white
people in the Southern states is descended from
those white freedmen. Prolonged isolation from
the currents of thought and feeling that sway the
great world will account for almost any extent of
ignorance and backwardness; and there are few
geographical situations east of the Mississippi River
more conducive to isolation than the southwestern
portion of the great Appalachian highlands. All
these circumstances should be borne in mind in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
dealing with what, from whatever point of view, is
one of the interesting problems of American history.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div id="Settlers_of_South_Carolina" class="sidenote">Settlers of
South Carolina.</div>

<p>The settlement of South Carolina took place
under different circumstances from those of the
sister colony, and the resulting state of
society was very different. In the earliest
days there were many settlers of a rough
and turbulent character, which their peculiar dealings
with pirates, to be recounted in the following
chapter, did not tend to improve. But the Huguenots,
in whose veins flowed some of the sturdiest
blood of France, soon came in great numbers.
From the acquaintanceship of the Berkeleys, the
Ashleys, the Hydes, and others, there came a certain
number of Cavaliers; but at the end of the
seventeenth century the impulse which had carried
thousands of Cavaliers to Virginia had quite died
out, and on the whole the general complexion of
South Carolina, as regarded religion and politics,
was strongly Puritan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Churchmen
and Dissenters.</div>

<div id="The_open_vestries" class="sidenote">The vestries.</div>

<p>In one respect there is a resemblance by no
means superficial between the settlement of South
Carolina and that of Massachusetts. Most of the
South Carolina settlers had left their homes in
Europe for reasons connected with religion; and
emigrants who quit their homes for such reasons
are likely to show a higher average of intelligence
and energy than the great mass of their fellow-countrymen
who stay at home. Calvinism was
the prevailing form of theology in South Carolina,
though there were some Lutherans, and perhaps
one fifth of the people may have belonged to the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
Church of England, which was established by the
proprietary charter, and remained the
state church until 1776. We have seen
how much disturbance was caused by the
attempts of the High Churchmen early in the
eighteenth century to enforce conformity on the
part of the Dissenters; but such attempts were
soon abandoned as hopeless, and a policy of toleration
prevailed. Though the Church of England
was supported by public taxation, yet the clergymen
were not appointed to office, but were elected
by their congregations like the Dissenting clergymen.
Their education was in general very good,
and their character lofty; and in all respects the
tone of the church in South Carolina was far
higher than in Virginia. At the outbreak of the
Revolution the elected Episcopal clergy of South
Carolina were generally found on the side of the
Whigs; a significant contrast to the appointed
Episcopal clergy of Virginia, whose Toryism was
carried so far as to ruin the reputation of their
church. But the most interesting feature connected
with the establishment of the English
Church was the introduction of the parish system
of local self-government in very much the same
form in which it existed in England. The vestries
in South Carolina discharged many of the functions
which in New England were performed
by the town meeting,&mdash;the superintendence
of the poor, the maintenance of roads, the
election of representatives to the Commons House
of Assembly, and the assessment of the local taxes.</p>

<div id="The_South_Carolina_parish" class="sidenote">The South
Carolina
parish.</div>

<p>In one fundamental respect the political constitution
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span>
of South Carolina was more democratic
than that of Virginia. The vestrymen
were elected yearly by all the taxpayers
of the parish. In this they were analogous
to the selectmen of New England. Parish
government in Virginia was in the hands of a close
vestry; in South Carolina it was administered by
an open vestry. Moreover, while in Virginia the
unit of representation in the legislature was the
county, in South Carolina it was the parish. Now
the South Carolina parish was of purely English
origin, not of French origin like the parishes of
Louisiana. The Louisiana parish is analogous
to a county, that of South Carolina was nearly
equivalent to a township.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a> Although the colony
had such a large proportion of French settlers, and
of such marked ability and character, the development
of its governmental institutions was as thoroughly
English as if no Frenchman had ever set
foot upon its soil. The approximation to the New
England township is interesting. The freemen of
South Carolina, with their open vestry, possessed
what the smaller landed proprietors of Virginia in
Bacon’s rebellion strove for in vain.</p>

<div id="Free_schools" class="sidenote">Free schools.</div>

<p>In this connection it is worth while to observe
that, from the first decade of the eighteenth century,
a strong interest in popular education was felt
in South Carolina. The same obstacles to schools
in the rural districts that we have already observed
in Virginia prevented the growth of anything like
the public school system of New England. But
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
of private free schools in the colony of South
Carolina there were quite a number, and
their quality was very good. The first
was established in Charleston in 1712, and it not
only taught the three Rs, along with bookkeeping,
but it had classes in Greek and Latin. Private
donations were encouraged by a provision that
every giver of £20 “could nominate a scholar to
be taught free for five years.” The commissioners
of the school also appointed twelve scholars.
Free schools were afterward erected by private
bequests and subscriptions at Dorchester, Beaufort,
Ninety-Six, and in many other places. A
noteworthy instance was afforded by St. Thomas
parish, where “James Childs bequeathed £600
toward erecting a free school, and the parishioners,
by local subscription, increased the amount to
£2,800.”<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> In such beginnings there lay the possibilities
of a more healthy development than can be
secured by the prevalent semi-socialist method of
supporting schools by public taxation;<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> but the
influences of negro slavery were adverse to any
such development.</p>

<div id="Rice_and_indigo" class="sidenote">Rice and indigo.</div>

<p>The economic circumstance which chiefly determined
the complexion of society in South Carolina
was the cultivation of rice and indigo. The value
of the former crop was discovered in 1693, when
a ship from Madagascar, accidentally stopping at
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
Charleston, had on board a little bag of rice, which
was planted with very notable success. Rice was
not long in becoming the great staple of
the colony. By 1740 it yielded more
than £200,000 yearly. Indigo was next in importance.
Much corn was raised, and cattle in large
numbers were exported to the West Indies. Some
attention was paid to silk, flax, and hemp, tobacco,
olives, and oranges. Some cotton was raised, but
that crop did not attain paramount importance
until after the invention of the gin and the development
of great factories in England.</p>

<p>Rice and indigo absorbed the principal attention
of the colony, as tobacco absorbed the attention of
Virginia. Manufactures did not thrive. Every
article, great or small, whether a mere luxury or
an article of prime necessity, that had to be manufactured,
was imported, and paid for with rice or
indigo. This created a very prosperous trade in
Charleston. The planters did not deal directly
with the shipmasters, as in Virginia, but sold their
crops to the merchants in Charleston, whence they
were shipped, sometimes in British, sometimes in
New England vessels, to all parts of the world.</p>

<div id="Some_characteristics_of_South_Carolina_slavery" class="sidenote">Some characteristics
of
South Carolina
slavery.</div>

<p>Now the cultivation of rice and the cultivation
of indigo are both very unhealthy occupations.
The work in the swamps is deadly to white men.
But after 1713 negroes were brought to South
Carolina in such great numbers that an athletic
man could be had for £40 or less. Every such
negro could raise in a single year much more
indigo or rice than would repay the cost of his
purchase, so that it was actually more profitable to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
work him to death than to take care of him. Assuming,
then, that human nature in South Carolina
was neither better nor worse than in other parts of
the civilized world, we need not be surprised when
told that the relations between master and slave
were noticeably different from what they were in
Virginia, Maryland, and North Carolina. The
negroes of the southern colony were reputed to be
more brutal and unmanageable than those to the
northward, and for this there is a twofold explanation.
In the first place, slaves newly brought
from Africa, half-savage heathen, were less tractable
than African slaves who had lived many years
under kindly treatment among white people, and
far less tractable than slaves of the next generation
born in America. Such newcomers
as had been tribal chiefs or elders in their
country were noted as especially
insolent and insubordinate.<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> In many respects the
negro has proved quickly amenable to the softening
influences of civilized life, and to the teachings
of Christianity, however imperfectly apprehended.
In the second place, the type of Virginia slavery
was old-fashioned and patriarchal, while South
Carolina slavery was of the modern and commercial
type. The slaves on a Virginia plantation
were like members of a great family, while in a
South Carolina rice swamp their position was
much more analogous to that of a gang of navvies.
This circumstance was closely connected with a peculiarity
of South Carolina life, in which it afforded
a striking contrast to the slave states north of it.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
Except in the immediate neighbourhood of Charleston,
few if any planters lived on their estates.
The reason for this was doubtless the desire to
escape the intense heat and unwholesome air of
the newly tilled lowlands. The latitude of South
Carolina is that of Morocco, and it was natural for
settlers coming from the cool or chilly climates of
France and England to seek such relief as the
breezes of Charleston harbour could afford.<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> As
a rule, the planters had houses in Charleston and
dwelt there the year round, making occasional
visits to their plantations, but leaving them in the
meanwhile to be managed by overseers. Thus the
slaves, while set to much harder labour than in
Virginia, were in the main left subject to the uncurbed
tyranny of underlings, which is apt to be
a very harsh kind of tyranny. The diminutions
in their numbers, whether due to hardship or to
whatever cause, were repaired by fresh importations
from Africa, so that there was much less improvement
in their quality than under the milder
patriarchal system. The dog that is used to kicks
is prone to snarl and bite, and the slaves of South
Carolina were an object of dread to their masters,
all the more so because of their overwhelming
numbers. Nothing can indicate more forcibly the
social difference between the two Carolinas than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
the different ratios of their black to their white
population. About 1760 the inhabitants of North
Carolina were reckoned at 200,000, of whom one
fourth were slaves; those of South Carolina at
150,000, of whom nearly or quite three fourths
were slaves. In the former case the typical picture
is that of a few black men raising tobacco
and corn on the small plantation where the master
lives; in the latter case it is that of an immense
gang toiling in a rice swamp under the lash of an
overseer. Care should always be taken not to exaggerate
such contrasts, but after making all allowances
the nature of the difference is here, I think,
correctly indicated.</p>

<div id="Negro_insurrection_of_1740" class="sidenote">Negro insurrection of 1740.</div>

<p>In 1740, while war was going on between Spain
and England, there was a brief but startling insurrection
of slaves in South Carolina. It was
suspected that Spanish emissaries were concerned
in it. However that may have been, the occasion
of such a war might well seem to the negroes to
furnish a good opportunity. Under the
lead of a fellow named Cato the insurgents
gathered near Stono Inlet and began
an indiscriminate massacre of men, women,
children. The alarm was quickly given and the
affair was soon brought to an end, though not
until too many lives had been lost. The news
arrived in Wilton while the people were attending
church. It was the custom of the planters to
carry rifles and pistols, and very little time was
lost before Captain Bee led forth a well-equipped
body of militia in quest of the rebels. They were
overtaken in a large field, all in hilarious disorder,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
celebrating their bloody achievement with potations
of rum; in which plight they were soon dispersed
with slaughter, and their ringleaders were
summarily hanged.<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a></p>

<div id="Cruelties" class="sidenote">Cruelties.</div>

<p>The habit of carrying fire-arms to church was
part of a general system of patrol which grew out
of the dread in which the planters lived. The
chief business of the patrol was to visit all the
plantations within its district at least once a fortnight
and search the negro quarters for concealed
weapons or stolen goods.<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> The patrolmen also
hunted fugitives, and were authorized to flog stray
negroes wherever found. The ordinary death penalty
for the black man was hanging. Burning at
the stake was not unknown, but, as I
have already mentioned, there is one instance
of such an execution in Massachusetts, and
there are several in New York, so that it cannot
be cited as illustrating any peculiarity of the South
Carolina type of slavery. The most hideous instance
of cruelty recorded of South Carolina is
that of a slave who for the murder of an overseer
was left to starve in a cage suspended to the bough
of a tree, where insects swarmed over his naked
flesh and birds had picked his eyes out before the
mercy of death overtook him.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a> That such atrocities
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
must have been condemned by public opinion
is shown by the act of 1740, prescribing a fine of
£700 current money for the wilful murder of a
slave by his master or any other white man; £350
for killing him in a sudden heat of passion, or by
undue correction; and £100 for inflicting mutilation
or cruel punishment.<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a></p>

<div id="Contrast_between_the_two_Carolinas" class="sidenote">Contrast between
the
two Carolinas.</div>

<p>The circumstance that most of the great planters
had houses in Charleston went along with the brisk
foreign trade to make it a very important town,
according to the American standards of those
days. In 1776, with its population of 15,000 souls,
it ranked as the fifth city of the United States.
Charleston had a theatre, while concerts,
balls, and dinner parties gave animation
to its social life. It was a general custom with
the planters to send their children to Europe for
an education, and it was said that a knowledge of
the world thus acquired gave to society in South
Carolina a somewhat less provincial aspect than
it wore in other parts of English America.<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a> The
sharpest contrast, however, was with its next neighbour.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
As South Carolina may have been in some
respects the most cosmopolitan of the colonies
south of Pennsylvania, so on the other hand North
Carolina was certainly the most sequestered and
provincial. As I observed at the beginning of
this chapter, for the development of the frontier
or backwoods phase of American life
two conditions were requisite: first, the
struggle with the wilderness; secondly,
isolation from European influences. This combination
of conditions was not realized in the
case of the first settlers of Virginia and Maryland,
of the Puritans in New England, or the Dutch in
New Netherland, or the Quakers in Pennsylvania.
In all these cases there was more or less struggle
with the wilderness, but the contact with European
influences was never broken. With North
Carolina it was different; the direct trade with
England was from the outset much less than that
of the other colonies. For a time its chief seaport
was Norfolk in Virginia; European ideas
reached it chiefly through slow overland journeys;
and it was practically a part of Virginia’s backwoods.
On the other hand, South Carolina, focussing
all its activities in the single seaport
of Charleston, was eminently accessible to European
influences. Its life was not that of a wilderness
frontier, like its northern neighbour. But
its military position, with reference to the whole
Atlantic seaboard, was that of an English march
or frontier against the Spaniards in Florida and
the West Indies.</p>

<p>The contrast above indicated applies only to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
lowland South Carolina, the only part with which
the earlier decades of the eighteenth century are
concerned. At that time the highlands of both
Carolinas remained in the possession of the Cherokees,
so that they have nothing to do with my
comparison. At a later time that whole highland
region became a wilderness frontier, the scene of
the civilized white man’s backwoods life. All the
way, indeed, from Pennsylvania to Georgia, along
the Appalachian chain, there was a strong similarity
of conditions and of life, in marked contrast
with the divergencies along the coast region, in
stepping from Pennsylvania into Maryland, thence
into Virginia, and so on; but that life along the
coast which approached most nearly to the life of
the interior wilderness was to be seen about Albemarle
and Pamlico sounds.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div id="The_Spanish_frontier" class="sidenote">The Spanish frontier.</div>

<p>The mention of Georgia serves to introduce the
statement that, with the growth of civilization on
the South Carolina coast, the need for a buffer
against the Spaniards began to be more and more
strongly felt. We have seen how the vexatious
Yamassee war of 1715 was brought on
by Spanish intrigues. After the overthrow
of the Yamassees the troubles did not entirely
cease. For some years the Indians continued to
be a source of annoyance, and in their misdeeds
the secret hand of Spain was discernible. The
multitude of slaves, too, in regions accessible to
Spanish influence, greatly increased the danger.</p>

<div id="James_Oglethorpe" class="sidenote">James Oglethorpe.</div>

<div id="Beginnings_of_Georgia" class="sidenote">Beginnings
of Georgia.</div>

<p>In 1732 the state of affairs on the South Carolina
frontier attracted the attention of a gallant
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
English soldier whose name deserves a very high
place among the heroes of early American history.
James Oglethorpe, an officer who
in youth had served with distinction
under Prince Eugene against the Turks,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> conceived
the plan of freeing the insolvent debtors
who crowded English prisons by carrying them
over to America and establishing a colony which
might serve as a strong military outpost against
the Spaniards. The scheme was an opportune
one, as the South Sea Bubble and other wild
projects had ruined hundreds of English families.
The land between the Savannah and Altamaha
rivers, with the strip starting between their two
main sources and running westward to the Pacific
Ocean,<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a> was made over to a board of trustees,
and was named Georgia, in honour of the king,
George II. The charter created a kind of proprietary
government, but with powers less plenary
and extensive than had been granted to the proprietors
of Maryland, Carolina, and Pennsylvania.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
Oglethorpe was appointed governor; German
Protestants and Highlanders from Scotland were
brought over in large numbers; and a few people
from New England joined in the enterprise, and
founded the town of Sunbury. All laws were to
be made by the trustees, and the settlers were at
first to have no representative assembly and no
voice in making the government. But this despotic
arrangement was merely temporary and provisional;
it was intended that after the lapse of
one-and-twenty years the colony should be held
to have come of age, and should choose its own
government. Military drill was to be rigidly
enforced. Slave-labour was absolutely prohibited,
as was also the sale of intoxicating liquors; so
that Maine cannot rightfully claim the doubtful
honour of having been the first American commonwealth
to try the experiment of a “Maine
Law.” Such were the beginnings of Georgia,
and in the Spanish war of 1739 it quite
justified the foresight of its founder.
The valour of the Highlanders and the admirable
generalship of Oglethorpe were an efficient bulwark
for the older colonies. In 1742 the Spaniards
were at last decisively defeated at Frederica,
and from that time forth until the Revolution the
frontier was more quiet. But proprietary government
in Georgia fared no better than in the Carolinas.
In 1752, one year before the coming of
age, the government by trustees was abandoned.
Georgia was made a crown colony, and a representative
government was introduced simultaneously
with negro slavery and Jamaica rum.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span></p>

<p>The social condition of colonial Georgia does
not present many distinctive or striking features.
In 1770 the population numbered about 50,000,
of which perhaps one half were slaves. There was
no town life. Rice and indigo were the principal
crops, and there was a large export of lumber.
Near Savannah there were a few extensive plantations,
with fine houses, after the Virginia pattern;
but most of the estates were small, and their owners
poor. The Church of England was supported
by the government, but the clergy had little
influence. The condition of the slaves differed
but slightly, if at all, from their condition in
South Carolina. There were a good many “mean
whites,” and there was, perhaps, more crime and
lawlessness than in the older colonies. The roads
were mere Indian trails, and there were neither
schools, nor mails, nor any kind of literature.
Colonial Georgia, in short, with many of the
characteristics of a “wild West,” stood in relation
to South Carolina somewhat as North Carolina
to Virginia. It was essentially a frontier
community, though the activity of Savannah as a
seaport somewhat qualified the situation.</p>

<div id="Cavaliers_and_Puritans" class="sidenote">Cavaliers and Puritans
once more.</div>

<p>A comparative survey of Old Virginia’s neighbours
shows how extremely loose and inaccurate
is the common habit of alluding to the old Cavalier
society of England as if it were characteristic of
the southern states in general. Equally loose and ignorant
is the habit of alluding to Puritanism
as if it were peculiar to New England.
In point of fact the Cavalier society was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
reproduced nowhere save on Chesapeake Bay.
On the other hand, the English or Independent
phase of Puritanism was by no means confined to
the New England colonies. Three fourths of the
people of Maryland were Puritans; English Puritanism,
with the closely kindred French Calvinism,
swayed South Carolina; and in our concluding
chapter we shall see how the Scotch or Presbyterian
phase of Puritanism extended throughout
the whole length of the Appalachian region, from
Pennsylvania to Georgia, and has exercised in the
southwest an influence always great and often
predominant. In the South to-day there is much
more Puritanism surviving than in New England.</p>

<p>But before we join in the westward progress
from tidewater to the peaks of the Blue Ridge
and the Great Smoky range, we must look back
upon the ocean for a moment and see how it came
to be infested with buccaneers and pirates, and
what effects they wrought upon our coasts.

<p id="At_no_other_time_in_the_world">At no other time in the world’s history has
the business of piracy thriven so greatly as in
the seventeenth century and the first part of the
eighteenth. Its golden age may be said to have
extended from about 1650 to about 1720. In
ancient times the seafaring was too limited in its
area to admit of such wholesale operations as went
on after the broad Atlantic had become a highway
between the Old World and the New. No doubt
those Cretan and Cilician pirates who were suppressed
by the great Pompey were terrible
fellows. After the destruction of
Carthage they controlled the Mediterranean from
the coast of Judæa to the Pillars of Hercules, and
captured the cargoes of Egyptian grain till at times
Rome seemed threatened with famine. Roman
commanders one after another went down before
them, until at length, in the year <small>B. C.</small> 67, Pompey
was appointed dictator over the Mediterranean
and all its coasts for fifty miles inland. The
dimensions of his task are indicated by the fact
that in the course of that year he captured 3,000
vessels, hung or crucified 10,000 pirates, and made
prisoners of 20,000 more, whom he hustled off to
hard labour in places far from the sound of surf.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_339">339</span>
Nevertheless those ancient pirates worked on a
much smaller scale than the buccaneers
of America. In the Indian Ocean
adjacent stretches of the Pacific there
has always been much piracy until the
recent days when French and English ships have
patrolled those waters. The fame of the Chinese
and Malays as sea robbers is well established. So
too with those vile communities north of Sahara
which we used to call the Barbary States, their
eminence in crime is unsurpassed. From the
fifteenth century to the first years of the nineteenth,
piracy was one of their chief sources of
revenue; their ships were a terror to the coasts of
Europe, and for devilish atrocity scarcely any
human annals are so black as those of Morocco
and Algiers. But as these Mussulman pirates
and those of eastern Asia were as busily at work
in the seventeenth century as at any other time,
their case does not impair my statement that the
age of the buccaneers was the Golden Age of
piracy. The deeds done in American waters
greatly swelled, if they did not more than double,
the volume of maritime robbery already existing.</p>

<p>If we look into mediæval history for examples
to compare with those already cited, we may
observe that the Scandinavian Vikings,
such men as sailed with Rolf and Guthorm
and Swegen Forkbeard, are sometimes
spoken of as pirates. If such a
classification of them were correct, we should be
obliged to assign the Golden Age of piracy to the
ninth and tenth centuries, for surely all other
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
slayings and plunderings done by seafaring men
shrink into insignificance beside the operations of
those mighty warriors of the North. But it is
neither a just nor a correct use of language that
would count as pirates a race of men who simply
made war like all their contemporaries, only more
effectively. The warfare of the Vikings was that
of barbarous heathen, but it was not criminal
unless it is a crime to be born a barbarian. The
moral difference between killing the enemy in
battle and murdering your neighbour is plain
enough. If there is any word which implies
thorough and downright criminality, it is pirate.
In the old English law the pirate was declared an
enemy to the human race, with whom no faith
need be kept. “As therefore,” says
Blackstone, “he has renounced all the
benefits of society and government, and
has reduced himself afresh to the savage state of
nature by declaring war against all mankind, all
mankind must declare war against him, and every
community hath a right by the rule of self-defence
to inflict that punishment upon him which every
individual would in a state of nature have been
otherwise entitled to do for any invasion of his
person or property.”<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> Pirates taken at sea were
commonly hung from the yard-arm without the
formality of a trial, and on land neither church
nor shrine could serve them as sanctuary. It was
also well understood that they were not included
in the benefit of a general declaration of pardon
or amnesty.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span></p>

<div id="Character_of_piracy" class="sidenote">Character of
piracy.</div>

<p>The pirate thus elaborately outlawed was anybody
who participated in violent robbery on the
high seas, or in criminal plunder along
their coasts. The details of such crimes
were apt to be full of cruelty. The capture of a
merchant ship with more or less bloodshed was
usually involved, and such bloodshed was wholesale
murder. If provisions were less than ample,
the survivors were thrown overboard, or set ashore
on some lonely island and left to starve, and this
often happened. Murders from sheer wantonness
were not uncommon, and the sack of a coast town
or village was attended with nameless horrors.
On the whole we cannot wonder that public opinion
should have branded the skippers and crews
who did such things as the very worst of criminals.
One can see that in old trials for piracy, as
in trials for witchcraft, the dread and detestation
were often so great as to outweigh the ordinary
English presumption that an accused person must
have the benefit of the doubt until proved guilty.
Desire to extirpate the crime became a stronger
feeling than reluctance to punish the innocent.
The slightest suspicion of complicity with pirates
brought with it extreme peril.</p>

<div id="To_call_the_Elizabethan_sea_kings" class="sidenote">To call the

<p>When we thus recall what the crime of piracy
really was, we cannot fail to see how reprehensible
is the language sometimes applied, by
writers who should know better, to the
noble sailors who in the days of Queen
Elizabeth saved England from the Spanish
Inquisition.<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a> Had it not been for the group
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
of devoted men among whom Sir Francis Drake
was foremost, there was imminent danger three
hundred years ago that human freedom might
perish from off the face of the earth. The name
of Drake is one that should never be uttered
without reverence, especially by Americans, since
it is clear that but for him our history would not
have begun in the days of Elizabeth’s successor.
His character was far loftier than that of Nelson,
the only other sea warrior whose achievements
have equalled his. His performances never transgressed
the bounds of legitimate warfare as it was
conducted in the sixteenth century. Among his
contemporaries he was exceptionally humane, for
he would not permit the wanton destruction of
life or property. To use language which even
remotely alludes to such a man as a pirate is to
show sad confusion of ideas. As for Elizabeth’s
other great captains,&mdash;such as Raleigh, Cavendish,
Hawkins, Gilbert, Grenville, Frobisher, Winter,
and the Howards,&mdash;few of them rose to the moral
stature of Drake, but they were very far above the
level of freebooters. It seems ridiculous that it
should be necessary to say so. Their business was
warfare, not robbery.</p>

<div id="Privateering" class="sidenote">Privateering.</div>

<p>It is nevertheless undeniable that naval warfare
in the days of Elizabeth stood on a lower moral
plane than naval warfare in the days of
Victoria, and things were done without
hesitation then that would not be tolerated
now. Wars are ugly things at best,
but civilized people have learned how to worry
through them without inflicting quite so much
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
misery as formerly. Three centuries ago not only
were the usages more harsh than now, but the
methods of conducting maritime warfare contained
a feature out of which, under favouring circumstances,
piracy afterward grew. There can be no
doubt that the seventeenth century was the golden
age of pirates because it came immediately after
the age of Elizabeth. The circumstances of the
struggle of the Netherlands and England against
the greatest military power in the world made it
necessary for the former to rely largely, and the
latter almost exclusively, upon naval operations.
Dutch ships on the Indian Ocean and English
ships off the American coasts effectually cut the
Spaniard’s sinews of war. Now in that age ocean
navigation was still in its infancy, and the work
of creating great and permanent navies was only
beginning. Government was glad to have individuals
join in the work of building and equipping
ships of war, and it was accordingly natural that
individuals should expect to reimburse themselves
for the heavy risk and expense by taking
a share in the spoils of victory. In this
way privateering came into existence, and it played
a much more extensive part in maritime warfare
than it now does. The navy was but incompletely
nationalized. Into expeditions that were
strictly military in purpose there entered some of
the elements of a commercial speculation, and as
we read them with our modern ideas we detect the
smack of buccaneering.</p>

<div id="Fighting_without_declaring_war" class="sidenote">Fighting
without declaring
war.</div>

<p>To this it should be added that fighting between
hostile states occurred much more frequently than
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span>
now without a formal declaration of war. There
were times in the thirteenth and fourteenth
centuries when the hatred between
the commercial rivals, Venice and Genoa,
was so fierce that whenever their ships happened
to meet on the Mediterranean they went to fighting
at sight, yet those bloody scrimmages did not
always lead to war. In the youth of Christopher
Columbus it was seldom that Christian and Turkish
ships met without bloodshed, on the assumption
that war was the normal state of things between
Crescent and Cross. So when the Dutch were
contending against Philip II. the English often
helped their heroic cousins by capturing Spanish
ships long before war was declared between Philip
and Elizabeth. Such laxity of international usage
made it easy to cross the line which demarcates
privateering from piracy.</p>

<div id="Lack_of_protection_for_neutral_ships" class="sidenote">Lack of protection
for
neutral
ships.</div>

<p>It should also be remembered that the ships of
neutral nations had no such protection as now.
The utmost that is now permitted the
belligerent ship is to search the neutral
ship for weapons or other materials of
war bound for an enemy’s port, and to confiscate
such materials without further injury to person or
property. In the sixteenth century it was allowable
to confiscate the neutral ship bound for an
enemy’s port, sell her cargo for prize money, and
hold her crew and passengers for ransom. The
milder doctrine that any kind of goods might be
seized, but not the ship and her people, had been
propounded but was not yet generally accepted.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Spanish
treasure.</div>

<p>All the circumstances here mentioned were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
favourable to the growth of piracy. At the same
time the temptations were unusually strong. There
was a vague widespread belief that America was
a land abounding in treasure, and there
were facts enough to explain such a belief.
Immense quantities of gold and silver were
carried across the Atlantic in Spanish ships, to say
nothing of other articles of value. This treasure
was used to support a war which threatened English
liberty, and therefore English cruisers were
right in seizing it wherever they could. But it
only needed that such cruising should fall into the
hands of knaves and ruffians, and that it should
be kept up after Spain and England were really
at peace, for this semi-mediæval warfare to develop
into a gigantic carnival of robbery and murder.
And so it happened.</p>

<div id="Origin_of_buccaneering" class="sidenote">Origin of
buccaneering.</div>

<p>It was toward the end of the sixteenth century,
in the course of the great Elizabethan war, that
the West Indies witnessed the first appearance of
the marauders known as “Brethren of the Coast.”
They were of various nationalities, chiefly
French, English, and Dutch. They all
regarded Spain as the world’s great bully
that must be teased. The Spaniards had won
such a reputation for tyranny and cruelty that
public opinion was not shocked when they were
made to swallow a dose or two of their own medicine.
After peace had been declared, any foreign
adventurers coming to the West Indies were liable
to be molested as intruders, and their ships sometimes
had to fight in self-defence. Wherefore the
more unscrupulous rovers, expecting ill-treatment,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
used not to wait for it, but when they saw a good
chance for robbing Spaniards they promptly seized
it. This they called, in the witty phrase of a
French captain, <i>se dédommager par avance</i>, or
recouping one’s self beforehand.</p>

<div id="Illicit_traffic" class="sidenote">Illicit
traffic.</div>

<p>It was not all the people of Spanish America,
however, that frowned upon foreigners. Among
those who came were sundry small traders of the
illicit sort. Like all semi-barbarous governments,
the court of Spain pursued a highly protectionist
policy. The colonists were not allowed to receive
European goods from any but Spanish ports, and
thus the Spanish exporters were enabled to charge
exorbitant prices. Many of the colonists therefore
welcomed smugglers who brought
European wares to exchange for cargoes
of sugar or hides. To suppress this traffic, the
authorities at San Domingo patrolled the coasts
with small cruisers known as <i>guardacostas</i>, and
when they caught the intruders they pitched them
overboard, or strung them up to the yard-arm,
without the smallest ceremony. In revenge the
intruders combined into fleets and made descents
upon the coasts, burning houses, plundering towns,
and committing all manner of outrages. Thus
there grew up in the West Indies a chronic state
of hostilities quite independent of Europe. It
came to be understood among the intruders that,
whether their countries were at peace or war with
one another, all persons coming to the West Indies
were friends and allies against that universal
enemy, the Spaniard. Thus these rovers took the
name of “Brethren of the Coast.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span></p>

<div id="Buccaneers_and_flibustiers" class="sidenote">Buccaneers
and “flibustiers.”</div>

<p>As the consequence of more than a century of
frightful misrule the beautiful island of Hispaniola,
or Hayti, had come to be in many parts deserted.
Many good havens were unguarded, and everywhere
there were immense herds of cattle and
swine running wild. Some of the brethren, mostly
Frenchmen, were thus led to settle in the island
and do a thriving business in hides, tallow, smoked
beef, and salted pork, which they bartered with
their sailor brethren for things smuggled
from Europe. They drove away the
Spaniards who tried to disturb them, and
amid perpetual fighting the island came to be more
and more French. Presently, from 1625 to 1630,
they took possession of the little islands of St.
Christopher and Nevis, and built strong fortifications
at Tortuga. About this time they began to
be called “boucaniers” or “buccaneers.” To cure
meat by smoking was called by the Indians “boucanning”
it. La Rochefort says of the Caribs that
they used to eat their prisoners well boucanned. In
the days before cattle came to the New World,
Americus Vespucius saw boucanned human shoulders
and thighs hanging in Indian cabins as one
would hang a flitch of bacon. The buccaneers
were named for the excellent boucanned beef and
pork which they sold. For their brethren on
shipboard another name was at first used. The
English word “freebooter” became in French
mouths “flibustier,” in spelling which a silent <i>s</i>
was inserted after the <i>u</i> by a false analogy, as so
often happens. In recent times “flibustier” has
come back into English as “filibuster,” a name
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
originally given to such United States adventurers
as William Walker, making raids upon Spanish-American
coasts in the interests of slavery. In
the first use of the epithets, if you lived on shore
and smoked beef you were a <i>boucanier</i>; but if you
lived on ship and smuggled or stole wherewithal
to buy the beef you were a <i>flibustier</i>. Naturally,
however, since so many of these restless brethren
passed back and forth from the one occupation to
the other, the names came to be applied indiscriminately,
and whether you called a scamp by
the one or the other made no difference.</p>

<div id="The_kind_of_people_who_became_buccaneers" class="sidenote">The kind of
people that
became buccaneers.</div>

<p id="The_honest_man_who_took_to_buccaneering">Those “Brethren of the Coast” were recruited
in every way that can be imagined. Cutthroats
and rioters, spendthrifts and debtors,
thieves and vagabonds, runaway apprentices,
broken-down tradesmen, soldiers
out of a job, escaped convicts, religious
cranks, youths crossed in love, every sort of man
that craved excitement or change of luck, came to
swell the numbers of the buccaneers. Graceless
sons of good families usually assumed some new
name. Yet not all were ashamed of their lawless
occupation. Some gloried in it, and deemed themselves
pinks of propriety in matters pertaining to
religion. One day, when a certain sailor was behaving
with unseemly levity in church while a priest
was saying mass, his captain suddenly stepped up
and rebuked him for his want of reverence, and
then blew his brains out. It is told of a Frenchman
from Languedoc that his career was determined
by reading a book on the cruelties of the
Spaniards in America, probably “The Destruction
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
of the Indies,” by Las Casas. This perusal inflamed
him with such furious hatred of Spaniards
that he conceived it to be his sacred mission to
kill as many as he could. So he joined the buccaneers,
and murdered with such exemplary diligence
that he came to be known as Montbars the Exterminator.
Another noted freebooter, Raveneau
de Lussan, joined the fraternity “because he was
in debt, and wished, as every honest man should
do, to have wherewithal to satisfy his creditors.”<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a></p>

<div id="Deeds_of_Olonnois" class="sidenote">Deeds of
Olonnois.</div>

<p>One of the early exploits of the brethren was
performed by Pierre of Dieppe, surnamed “the
Great.” In a mere longboat, with a handful of
men, he surprised and captured the Spanish vice-admiral’s
ship, heavily freighted with treasure, set
her people ashore in Hispaniola, and took his prize
to France. This exploit is said to have given
quite an impetus to buccaneering. In 1655 the
buccaneers had grown so powerful that they gave
important aid to Cromwell’s troops in conquering
Jamaica. When any nation went to war with
Spain, the buccaneers of that nationality would
get from the government letters of marque, which
made them privateers and entitled them to certain
rights of belligerents. Their aid was so liable to
be useful in time of need that the English and
French governments connived at some of their
performances. No civilized government could
countenance their cruelties. One monster, called
Olonnois, having captured a Spanish ship
with a crew of ninety men, beheaded
them all with a sabre in his own hands. Four
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
cases are on record in which he threw the whole
crew overboard, and it is said that he sometimes
tore out and devoured the bleeding hearts of his
victims, after the Indian fashion. In concert with
another wretch, Michel le Basque (whose name
tells his origin), at the head of 650 men, he captured
the towns of Gibraltar and Maracaibo, in
the Gulf of Venezuela, and carried off a booty of
nearly half a million crowns, equivalent to more
than two million modern dollars. Prisoners were
tortured to disclose hidden treasure. But this
precious Olonnois was soon afterward paid in his
own coin: he fell into the hands of a party of
hungry Indians, who cooked and ate him.</p>

<div id="Henry_Morgan" class="sidenote">Henry
Morgan.</div>

<p>Such incidents as these in Venezuela made many
Spanish towns prefer to buy off the buccaneers,
and thus a system of blackmail was established.
It was for the buccaneer to decide for himself
whether he deemed it more profitable to end all in
one mad frolic of plunder and slaughter, or to
accept a round sum and leave the town for the
present unharmed. Operations on a grand scale
began about 1664, under a leader named Mansvelt,
who soon died and was succeeded
by Henry Morgan, the most famous of
the buccaneers and one of the vilest of the fraternity.
This Welshman is said to have been of
good family and well brought up. He made his
way to Barbadoes as a redemptioner, and after
serving out his term joined the pirates. He was
a man of remarkable courage and resource. For
cruelty no Apache could surpass him, and his perfidy
equalled his cruelty. He paid so little heed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
to the maxims of honour among thieves that it is
a wonder he should have retained his leadership
through several expeditions.</p>

<p>One of Morgan’s early exploits was the capture
of Puerto del Principe, in Cuba. Then with 500
men he attacked Porto Bello, on the Isthmus of
Darien. Having taken a convent, he forced the
nuns to carry scaling ladders and plant them
against the walls of the citadel, perhaps in the
hope that Spaniards would not fire upon Spanish
women; but many of the poor nuns were killed.
After the garrison had surrendered, Morgan set
fire to the magazine and blew into fragments the
fort with its defenders. The scenes that followed
must have won Satan’s approval. With greed
unsatisfied by the enormous booty, the monster
devised horrible tortures for the discovery of secret
hoards that doubtless existed only in his fancy.
Many victims died under the infliction.</p>

<div id="Alexander_Exquemeling" class="sidenote">Alexander
Exquemeling.</div>

<p>Soon afterward Morgan met in the Caribbean
Sea a powerful French pirate ship and invited her
to join him. On the French captain’s refusal,
Morgan, with an air of supreme cordiality, invited
him to come over to dinner with all his officers.
No sooner had these guests arrived than they were
seized and put in irons, while Morgan attacked
their ship and captured it. Then came a strange
retribution. Morgan put some of his own officers
with 350 of his crew into the French ship; presently
the officers got drunk, and through accident
or carelessness the ship was blown up with all
the English crew and the French prisoners. This
story is told by a pious and literary Dutch buccaneer,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
the fraternity’s best historian, by name Alexander
Exquemeling, sometimes corrupted
into Oexmelin. His well-written narrative
was first published at Amsterdam in
1678, entitled <i>De Americansche Zee Roovers</i>. It
has been translated into nearly all the languages
of Europe, and ranks among the most popular
books of the last two centuries.<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> The pious Exquemeling,
in recounting the explosion of the captured
ship, sees in it a special divine judgment
upon Morgan for treachery to guests, a kind of
philosophizing which is duly ridiculed by Voltaire
in his “Candide.”<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span></p>

<div id="Maracaibo_and_Gibraltar" class="sidenote">Maracaibo
and Gibraltar.</div>

<p>The loss of 350 men and a ship better than any
of his own was a serious blow to Morgan, but it
did not prevent him from capturing those
unhappy towns, Maracaibo and Gibraltar,
where he shut up a crowd of prisoners
in a church and left them to die of starvation.
His own escape from capture, however, was a
narrow one. Three Spanish galleons arrived at
the entrance to the Gulf of Venezuela and strongly
garrisoned a castle that stood there, so that it
began to look as if the day of reckoning for
Morgan had come. But he made one of his vessels
into a fire-ship and succeeded in burning two of
the galleons. Then it became easy for his little
fleet to surround and capture the third, after
which a masterly series of stratagems enabled him
to slip past the castle, richer by a million dollars
than when he entered the Gulf, and ready for
fresh deeds of wickedness.</p>

<div id="Morgan_absconds" class="sidenote">Morgan absconds.</div>

<p>The British government lamented these cruel
aggressions upon people whose only offence was
that of having been born Spaniards, and in 1670
a treaty was made between Spain and Great Britain
for the express purpose of putting an end to
buccaneering. This interesting treaty, which was
conceived in an unusually liberal and enlightened
spirit, was called the treaty of America.
As soon as the buccaneers heard of it,
they resolved to make a defiant and
startling exhibition of their power. Thirty-seven
ships, carrying more than 2,000 men of various
nationalities, were collected off the friendly meat-curing
coast of Hispaniola. Morgan was put in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
the chief command, and it was decided to capture
Panama. On arriving at the isthmus they stormed
the castle at the mouth of the river Chagres and
put the garrison to the sword. Thus they gained
an excellent base of operations. Leaving part
of his force to guard castle and fleet, Morgan at
the head of 1,200 men made the difficult journey
across the isthmus in nine days. Panama was not
fortified, but a force of 2,000 infantry and 400
horse confronted the buccaneers. In an obstinate
battle, without quarter asked or given, the Spaniards
lost 600 men and gave way. The city was
then at the mercy of the victors. It contained
about 7,000 houses and some handsome
churches, but Morgan set fire to it in
several places, and after a couple of days nearly
all these buildings were in ashes. By the light of
those flames most hideous atrocities were to be seen,&mdash;such
a carnival of cruelty and lust as would have
disgraced the Middle Ages. After three bestial
weeks the buccaneers departed with a long train
of mules laden with booty, and several hundred
prisoners, most of whom were held for ransom.
Among these were many gentlewomen and children,
whom Morgan treated savagely. He kept
them half dead with hunger and thirst, and swore
that if they failed to secure a ransom he would sell
them for slaves in Jamaica. Exquemeling draws
a pathetic picture of the poor ladies kneeling and
imploring at Morgan’s feet while their starving
children moaned and cried; the only effect upon
the ruffian was to make him ask them how much
ransom they might hope to secure if these things
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
were made known to their friends. When the
party arrived at Chagres, there was a division of
spoil, and the rascals were amazed to find how
little there seemed to be to distribute. Morgan
was accused of loading far more than his rightful
share upon his own vessels, whereupon, not wishing
to argue the matter, he made up his
mind to withdraw from the scene, “which
he did,” says our chronicler, “without calling any
council or bidding any one adieu, but went
secretly on board his own ship and put out to sea
without giving notice, being followed only by
three or four vessels of the whole fleet, who it is
believed went shares with him in the greatest part
of the spoil.” All that can be said for him is
that most of his comrades would gladly have done
the same by him.</p>

<div id="Scotching_the_snake" class="sidenote">Scotching the snake.</div>

<p>With Morgan’s departure the pirate fleet was
scattered, and plenty of strong language was used
in reference to their tricksome commodore.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> The
arrival of a new English governor at Jamaica,
with instructions to enforce the treaty of America,
led to the hanging of quite a number of buccaneers;
and a crew of 300 French pirates,
shipwrecked on the coast of Porto Rico, were
slaughtered by order of the Spanish governor.
But such casualties produced little effect upon the
swarming multitude of rovers, and within half a
dozen years we find the governor of Jamaica conniving
at them and sharing in their plunder.
One pirate crew brought in a
Spanish ship so richly freighted that there was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
£400 for every man after a round sum in hush-money
had been handed to the governor. Then
the pirates burned the ship and embarked in
respectable company for England, “where,” says
Exquemeling, “some of them live in good reputation
to this day.”</p>

<div id="Morgans_metamorphosis" class="sidenote">Morgan’s metamorphosis.</div>

<p>But what shall we say when we find the devil
turning monk, when we see the arch-pirate Morgan
administering the king’s justice upon his
quondam comrades and sending them by scores to
the gallows! It reads like a scene in comic opera,
how this dirty fellow, after absconding with a
lion’s share of the Panama spoil and bringing it
to Jamaica, suddenly put on airs of righteousness,
wooed and won the fair daughter of one of the
most eminent personages on the island, and was
appointed a judge of the admiralty court.
The finishing touch was put upon the
farce when Charles II. decorated him with
knighthood. It is not clear how he won the king’s
favour, but we know that Charles was not above
taking tips. After this our capacity for amazement
is so far exhausted that we read with benumbed
acquiescence how in 1682 Sir Henry Morgan
was appointed deputy-governor of Jamaica.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a> But
when we find him handing over to the tender
mercies of the Spaniards a whole crew of English
buccaneers who had fallen into his clutches, we
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
seem to recognize the old familiar touch, and
cannot repress the suspicion that he sold them for
hard cash! He remained in office three years,
until James II. ascended the throne, when the
Spanish government accused him of secret complicity
with the pirates. On this charge he was
removed from office and sent to England, where
he was for some years imprisoned but never met
the fate which he deserved.</p>

<div id="Decline_of_buccaneering" class="sidenote">Decline of
buccaneering.</div>

<p id="Morgans_Downfall">Exquemeling expresses the opinion that, after
the trick which Morgan played upon his comrades
at Chagres, he must have thought it more prudent
to be on the side of government than to stay
with the buccaneers. He may also have foreseen
that sooner or later the treaty of America was
likely to interfere with the business of piracy. It
is curious that, after all his caution, his downfall
on a charge brought by Spain before the British
government was due to the treaty of America.
Although imperfectly enforced, that treaty seems
to have marked the turning point in the
history of buccaneering. The sack of
Panama was the apogee of the golden
age of pirates; the events that followed are incidents
in a gradual but not slow decline. In 1684
the number of French buccaneers in the West
Indies and on adjacent coasts was estimated at
3,000, and of other nationalities there were perhaps
as many more; but their operations were on
a smaller and tamer scale than those of Olonnois
and Morgan.</p>

<div id="Pirates_of_the_South_Sea" class="sidenote">Buccaneers
of the South
Sea.</div>

<p>About this time the South Sea began to be the
favourite field of work for some of the most famous
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
buccaneers. In 1680 the first party crossed the
isthmus and set sail on the Bay of Panama in a
swarm of canoes, with which on the same day
they captured a Spanish vessel of 30 tons. With
this ship they captured another the next day,
and so on till at the end of the week they were in
possession of quite a fleet, comprising
some ships of 400 tons. They cruised as
far as the island of Juan Fernandez and
beyond, capturing many ships and much treasure,
but not doing much harm ashore. One of the
officers, Basil Ringrose, an educated man, left a
journal of this cruise, the original manuscript of
which is in the British Museum. Other voyages
followed until the buccaneers had visited such
remote places as the Ladrone Islands, Easter
Island, the coasts of Australia, and Tierra del
Fuego. Among their commanders were men of
far better type than those that have hitherto been
mentioned; such were Ambrose Cowley, Edward
Davis, the surgeon Lionel Wafer, and the celebrated
William Dampier, whom we are more wont
to remember as a great navigator and explorer
than as a pirate. Cowley, Wafer, and Dampier
have left charming narratives of their adventures,
in which a mixture of scientific inquisitiveness
with the love of barbaric independence is more
conspicuous than mere greed. As Henry Morgan
was a pirate of the worst type, so Edward Davis,
discoverer of Easter Island, was of the best. He
never would permit acts of cruelty or wanton
bloodshed, and his loyalty and kindness to his
comrades won their affection, so that his mellowing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span>
influence over rough natures was remarkable.
In 1688 he took advantage of a royal proclamation
of amnesty to quit buccaneering and go
to England, where he was afterward counted as

<p>As we read the journals of those remote voyages
it is easy to forget for a moment that the business
is piracy. We seem to see the staunch ships,
superbly handled by their expert sailors, blithely
cleaving the blue waters under the Southern Cross;
we breathe the cool salt breeze; we watch with
interest the gray cliffs, the strange foliage, the
birds and snakes and insects which arouse the
curiosity of the mariners; we follow them to the
Galapagos Islands, which first suggested to Darwin
and afterward to Wallace the theory of
natural selection; we note with pleasure their
description of the uncouth natives of Australia;
and we remember Thackeray when we encounter
oysters so huge that Basil Ringrose has to cut
them in quarters.<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> In the careless freedom of life
on an unknown sea with each morrow bringing its
new adventures, we forget what company we are
in, till suddenly the victim ship heaves in sight,
the brief chase ends in a deadly struggle, the
Spanish colours go down before the black flag, a
few bodies are buried in the depths, and a rich
spoil is divided. It is vulgar robbery and
murder after all, and there was a good
deal of it in the South Sea. The coast
of Peru, where there were the richest towns, suffered
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
the most. The Lima Almanacs for 1685-87,
comprising an official record of events for each
year immediately preceding, mention the towns of
Guayaquil, Santiago de Miraflores, and five others
as plundered by the pirates. When Davis divided
his booty at Juan Fernandez, there was enough
to give every man a sum equivalent to $20,000.
Very often a pirate got more gold and silver than
he could handle or carry, but it was apt to slip
away easily. Many of Davis’s company quickly
lost every dollar in gambling with their comrades.
Our friend Raveneau de Lussan, who took
to piracy in order to satisfy his creditors, tells
his readers that his winnings at play, added to
his share of booty, amounted to 30,000 pieces of
eight, which would now be equivalent to at least
$120,000; so we may hope that he paid his debts
like an honest man.</p>

<div id="Effects_of_the_alliance_between_France_and_Spain" class="sidenote">Effects of
the alliance
between
France and
Spain.</div>

<p>The event which did more than anything else to
put an end to buccaneering was the accession of a
Bourbon prince, Philip V., to the throne
of Spain in 1701. It was then that his
grandfather, Louis XIV., declared there
were no longer any Pyrenees. Ever since
the days of Ferdinand and Isabella, Spain and
France had been enemies. Their relations now
became so friendly that all the ports of Spanish
America, whether in the West Indies or on the
Pacific coast, were thrown open to French merchants.
This made trade more profitable than
piracy, and united the French and Spanish navies
in protecting it. The English and Dutch fleets
also put forth redoubled efforts, and during the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
next score of years the decline of the pirates was
rapid.</p>

<div id="Carolina_and_the_Bahamas" class="sidenote">Carolina
and the
Bahamas.</div>

<p>The first English settlements south of Virginia
were made at the time when buccaneering was
mighty and defiant. The colony of Sir
John Yeamans, on Cape Fear River, was
begun in 1665, and it was in 1670, the
very year of the treaty of America, that Governor
Sayle landed at Port Royal. The earliest settlers
in Carolina, as we have seen, were not of
such good quality as those who came a few years
later. They furnished a convenient market for
the pirates, who were apt to be open-handed customers,
ready to pay good prices in Spanish gold,
whether for clothes, weapons, and brandy brought
from Europe, or for timber, tar, tobacco, rice, or
corn raised in America. One of the Bahama
Islands, called New Providence, had been settled
by the English. Its remarkable facilities for
anchorage and its convenient situation made it a
favourite haunt of pirates, whose evil communications
corrupted the good manners of the inhabitants.
Rather than lose such customers they
befriended them in every possible way, so that
the island became notorious as one of the worst
nests of desperadoes in the American waters. The
malady was not long in spreading to the mainland.
The Carolina coast, with its numerous
sheltered harbours and inlets, afforded excellent
lurking-places, whither one might retreat from
pursuers, and where one might leisurely repair
damages and make ready for further mischief.
The pirates, therefore, long haunted that coast,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span>
and it was rather a help than a hindrance to them
when settlements began to be made there. For
now instead of a wilderness it became a market
where they could buy food, medicines, tools, or
most of such things as they needed. So long as
they behaved moderately well while ashore, it was
not necessary for the Carolinians to press them
with questions as to what they did on the high
seas. For at least thirty years after the founding
of Carolina, nearly all the currency in the colony
consisted of Spanish gold and silver brought in by
freebooters from the West Indies.</p>

<div id="Effect_of_the_Navigation_Laws" class="sidenote">Effect of the
Navigation
Laws.</div>

<p>Nothing went so far toward making the colonists
tolerate piracy as the Navigation Laws which
we have already described. We have
seen how they enabled English merchants
to charge exorbitant prices for
goods shipped to America, and to pay as little as
possible for American exports. The contrast between
such customers and the pirates was entirely
in favour of the latter, who could afford to be
liberal both with goods and with cash that had
cost them nothing but a little fighting.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a> After the
founding of Charleston, the dealings with pirates
there were made the subject of complaint in London.
In 1684 Robert Quarry, acting governor
of Carolina, a man of marked ability and good
reputation, was removed from office for complicity
with pirates. This did not, however, prevent his
being appointed to other responsible positions.
His successor, Joseph Morton, actually gave permission
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
to two buccaneer captains to bring their
Spanish prizes into the harbour. Soon afterward
John Boon, a member of the council, was expelled
for holding correspondence with freebooters.
At the close of Ludwell’s administration, it was
said that Charleston fairly swarmed with pirates,
against whose ill-got gold the law was powerless.
Along with such commercial reasons, the terror of
their fame conspired to protect them. Desperadoes
who had sacked Maracaibo and Panama might do
likewise to Charleston or New York. It was not
only in Carolina that such fears combined with
the Navigation Laws to sustain piracy. In Pennsylvania
a son of the deputy-governor Markham
was elected to the Assembly, but not allowed to
take a seat because of dealings with the freebooters.
Governor Fletcher, of New York, was deeply
implicated in such proceedings, and the record of
distant New England was far from stainless.</p>

<div id="Effect_of_rice_culture" class="sidenote">Effect of
rice culture.</div>

<p id="Wholesale_hanging_of_pirates">But at the end of the seventeenth century a
marked change became visible. In South Carolina
the cultivation of rice had reached
such dimensions that tonnage enough
could not be found to carry the crop of 1699
across the Atlantic. The colonists were allowed
to sell in foreign markets such goods as were not
wanted in England, and England took very little
rice. Most of it went to Holland, Hamburg,
Bremen, Sweden, Denmark, and Portugal. As
rice was thus becoming the chief source of income
for South Carolina, people began to be sorely
vexed when pirates captured their cargoes. Besides
this, the character of the population was entirely
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_364">364</span>
changed by the influx of steady, law-abiding English
dissenters under Blake, and by the immigration
of large numbers of Huguenots. The pirates
became unpopular, and the year 1699 witnessed
the hanging of seven of them at Charleston. As
the colony yearly grew stronger and the administration
firmer, such rigours increased, and the
great gallows on Execution Dock was decorated
with corpses swinging in chains, a dozen or more
at a time, until the pirates came to think of that
harbour as a place to be shunned.</p>

<div id="North_Carolina" class="sidenote">North
Carolina.</div>

<p>There still remained for them, however, an
excellent place of refuge in the neighbourhood.
In the year 1700 Edward Randolph reported
that the population of North
Carolina consisted of smugglers, runaway servants,
and pirates. There is no doubt that for
the latter it furnished a favourite hiding-place.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Swarms of pirates.</div>

<p>For some years after 1700 the vigorous measures
of South Carolina kept her own coast comparatively
safe, but the snake was as yet
only scotched. Swarms of buccaneers,
though far thinner than of old, were still harboured
in the West Indies, and when occasion was
offered they came out of their dens. In 1715,
when South Carolina was nearly exhausted from
her great Indian war, with crops damaged and
treasury empty and military gaze turned toward
the frontier and away from the coast, the pirates
swarmed there again, with numbers swelled by
rovers and bandits turned adrift by the peace of
Utrecht in 1713. James Logan, Secretary of
Pennsylvania, reported in 1717 that there were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span>
1,500 pirates on our coasts, with their chief headquarters
at Cape Fear and New Providence, from
which points they swept the sea from Newfoundland
to Brazil. For South Carolina there was
ground of alarm lest wholesale pillage of rice
cargoes should bring ruin upon the colony. But
that year 1717 saw the arrival of the able governor
Robert Johnson, who was destined, after
some humiliation, to suppress the nuisance of
piracy.</p>

<div id="New_Providence_redeemed" class="sidenote">New Providence redeemed.</div>

<p id="last_lair_for_the_pirates">The next year, 1718, was the beginning of
the end. In midsummer an English fleet, under
Woodes Rogers, captured the island of
New Providence, expelled the freebooters,
and established there a strong company
of law-abiding persons. Henceforth New
Providence became a smiter of the wicked instead
of their hope and refuge. It was like capturing a
battery and turning it against the enemy. One
of its immediate effects, however, was to turn the
whole remnant of the scoundrels over to the North
Carolina coast, where they took their final stand.
For a moment the mischief seemed to have increased.
One deed, in particular, is vivid in its
insolence.</p>

<div id="Blackbeard_the_Last_of_the_Pirates" class="sidenote">Blackbeard,
the “Last of
the Pirates.”</div>

<p>Among these corsairs one of the boldest was a
fellow whose name appears in court records as
Robert Thatch, though some historians
write it Teach. He was a native of
Bristol in England, and his real name
seems to have been Drummond. But the soubriquet
by which he was most widely known was
“Blackbeard.” It was a name with which mothers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
and nurses were wont to tame froward children.
This man was a ruffian guilty of all crimes known
to the law, a desperate character who would stick
at nothing. For many years he had been a terror
to the coast. In June, 1718, he appeared before
Charleston harbour in command of a forty-gun
frigate, with three attendant sloops, manned in
all by more than 400 men. Eight or ten vessels,
rashly venturing out, were captured by him, one
after another, and in one of them were several
prominent citizens of Charleston, including a
highly respected member of the council, all bound
for London. When Blackbeard learned the quality
of his prisoners, his fertile brain conceived
a brilliant scheme. His ships were in need of
sundry medicines and other provisions, whereof a
list was duly made out and entrusted to a mate
named Richards and a party of sailors, who went
up to Charleston in a boat, taking along one of
the prisoners with a message to Governor Johnson.
The message was briefly this, that, if the
supplies mentioned were not delivered to Blackbeard
within eight-and-forty hours, that eminent
commander would forthwith send to Governor
Johnson, with his compliments, the heads of all
his prisoners.</p>

<div class="sidenote">South Carolina
government
over-awed.</div>

<p>It was a terrible humiliation, but the pirate had
calculated correctly. Governor and council saw
that he had them completely at his mercy.
They knew better than he how defenceless
the town was; they knew that his
ships could batter it to pieces without effective
resistance. Not a minute must be lost, for Richards
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
and his ruffians were strutting airily about the
streets amid fierce uproar, and, if the mob should
venture to assault them, woe to Blackbeard’s captives.
The supplies were delivered with all possible
haste, and Blackbeard released the prisoners
after robbing them of everything they had, even
to their clothing, so that they went ashore nearly
naked. From one of them he took $6,000 in coin.
After this exploit Blackbeard retired to North
Carolina, where it is said that he bought the connivance
of Charles Eden, the governor, who is
further said to have been present at the ceremony
of the pirate’s marriage to his fourteenth wife.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a></p>

<div id="Fate_of_Bonnet_and_Blackbeard" class="sidenote">Fate of
Bonnet.</div>

<p>While the arch-villain, thus befriended, was
roaming the coast as far as Philadelphia and
bringing his prizes into Pamlico Sound, another
rover was making trouble for Charleston.
Major Stede Bonnet, of Barbadoes, had
taken up the business of piracy scarcely
two years before. He had served with
credit in the army and was now past middle life,
with a good reputation and plenty of money, when
all at once he must needs take the short road to
the gallows. Some say it was because his wife was
a vixen, a droll reason for turning pirate. But
in truth there was a moral contagion in this
business. The case of William Kidd, a few years
before Bonnet, is an illustration. Kidd was an
able merchant, with a reputation for integrity,
when William III. sent him with a swift and
powerful ship to chase pirates; and, lo! when
with this fine accoutrement he brings down less
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span>
game than he had hoped, he thinks it will pay
better to turn pirate himself. In this new walk
of life he goes on achieving eminence, until on a
summer day he rashly steps ashore in Boston, is
arrested, sent to London, and hung.<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> Evidently
there was a spirit of buccaneering in the air, as in
the twelfth century there was a spirit of crusading.
And even as children once went on a crusade, so we
find women climbing the shrouds and tending the
guns of pirate ships.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> Major Bonnet soon became
distinguished in his profession, and committed
depredations all the way from Barbadoes to the
coast of Maine. Late in the summer of 1718
Governor Johnson learned that there was a pirate
active in his neighbourhood, and he sent Colonel
William Rhett, with two armed ships, to chase
him. The affair ended in an obstinate fight at
the mouth of Cape Fear River, in the course of
which all the ships got aground on sand-bars. It
was clear that whichever combatant should first be
set free by the rising tide would have the other at
his mercy, and we can fancy the dreadful eagerness
with which every ripple was watched. One
of Rhett’s ships was first to float, and just as she
was preparing to board the pirate he
surrendered. Then it was learned that
he was none other than the famous Stede Bonnet.
At the last his brute courage deserted him, and
the ecstasy of terror with which he begged for life
reminds one of the captive in “Rob Roy” who
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
was hurled into Loch Lomond. But entreaty fell
upon deaf ears. It was a gala day at Execution
Dock when Bonnet and all his crew were hung in
chains.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Fate of
Blackbeard.</div>

<p>A few weeks later, while Blackboard was lurking
in Ocracoke Inlet, with ship well armed and
ready for some fresh errand, he was overhauled
by two stout cruisers sent after
him by Governor Spotswood, of Virginia. In a
desperate and bloody fight the “Last of the
Pirates” was killed. All the survivors of his
crew were hanged, and his severed head decorated
the bowsprit of the leading ship as she returned
in triumph to James River.</p>

<p>Such forceful measures went on till the waters
of Carolina were cleared of the enemy, and by
1730 the fear of pirates was extinguished. For
year after year the deeds of Kidd and Blackbeard
were rehearsed at village firesides, and tales of
buried treasure caused many a greedy spade to
delve in vain, until with the lapse of time the
memory of all these things grew dim and faded
away.

Spotswood.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Governor
and burgesses.</div>

<div class="sidenote">A sharp
rebuke.</div>

<p>It is time for our narrative to return to Virginia,
where in June, 1710, just a hundred years
after the coming of Lord Delaware, there arrived
upon the scene one of the best and ablest of all
the colonial governors. Alexander Spotswood was
a member of the old and honourable
Scottish family which took its name
from the barony of Spottiswoode, in Berwick.
His great-great-grandfather had been archbishop
of St. Andrews and chancellor of Scotland. His
great-grandfather, Sir Robert Spottiswoode, as
secretary of state, had signed the commission of
Montrose, for which he was beheaded by the Covenanters
in 1646.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> Alexander himself had been
brought up from childhood in the army, where he
had seen some hard fighting. Already at the age
of eight-and-twenty he had attained the rank of
colonel, and in that year received an ugly wound
at Blenheim. Six years after that great battle
he arrived in Virginia, a tall, robust man, with
gnarled and wrinkled face and an air of dignity
and power. He was greeted at Williamsburg
with more than ordinary cordiality, because he
brought with him a writ confirming the claim of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
the Virginians that they were as much entitled as
other Englishmen to the privilege of <i>habeas corpus</i>.
Notwithstanding this auspicious reception
he had a good many wrangles with his
burgesses, chiefly over questions of taxation,
and sometimes talked to them
quite plainly. On one occasion when, during the
Yamassee war in Carolina, he requested an appropriation
for a force to be sent in aid of their
southern neighbours, he found the burgesses less
liberal than he wished and expected. They
pleaded the poverty of the country as an excuse
for not doing more. The governor’s retort was a
telling one, and might be applied with effect to
many a modern legislative body. If they felt the
poverty of the country so keenly, why did they persist
in sitting there day after day and drawing
their pay, while they wasted the country’s time in
frivolities without passing laws that were much
needed? for in the last five-and-twenty days only
three bills had come from them. At the end of
a stormy session he addressed them still more
sharply: “To be plain with you, the true interest
of your country is not what you have
troubled your heads about. All your proceedings
have been calculated to answer the notions
of the ignorant populace; and if you can excuse
yourselves to them, you matter not how you stand
before God, or any others to whom you think you
owe not your elections. In fine, I cannot but
attribute these miscarriages to the people’s mistaken
choice of a set of representatives whom
Heaven has not ... endowed with the ordinary
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
qualifications requisite to legislators; and therefore
I dissolve you!”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a></p>

<p>In spite of this stinging tongue Spotswood was
greatly liked and respected for his ability and
honesty and his thoroughly good heart. He was
a man sound in every fibre, clear-sighted, shrewd,
immensely vigorous, and full of public spirit.
One day we find him establishing Indian missions;
the next he is undertaking to smelt iron
and grow native wines; the next he is sending out
ships to exterminate the pirates. For his energy
in establishing smelting furnaces he was nicknamed
“The Tubal Cain of Virginia.” For the
making of native wines he brought over a colony
of Germans from the Rhine, and settled them in
the new county named for him Spottsylvania, hard
by the Rapidan River, where Germanna Ford still
preserves a reminiscence of their coming.</p>

<div id="The_Post_office_Act" class="sidenote">The Post-office
Act.</div>

<p>Some of Spotswood’s disputes with the assembly
brought up questions akin to those which
agitated the country half a century later, in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
days of the Stamp Act. A recent act of Parliament
had extended the post-office system
into Virginia, whereupon the burgesses
declared that Parliament had no authority to lay
any tax (such as postage) upon the people of
Virginia without the consent of their representatives;
accordingly they showed their independence
by exempting from postage all merchants’
letters. But we may let Spotswood speak for
himself: “Some time last Fall the Post M’r
Gen’ll of America, having thought himself
Obliged to endeavour the Settling a post through
Virginia and Maryland, in y<sup>e</sup> same manner as
they are settled in the other Northern Plantations,
pursu’t to the Act of Parliament of the 9th
of Queen Anne, gave out Commissions for that
purpose, and a post was accordingly established
once a fortnight from W’msburg to Philadelphia,
and for the Conveyance of Letters bro’t hither by
Sea through the several Countys. In order to this,
the Post M’r Set up printed Placards (such as were
sent in by the Post M’r Gen’ll of Great Britain)
at all the Posts, requiring the delivery of all Letters
not excepted by the Act of Parliament to be
delivered to his Deputys there. No sooner was
this noised about but a great Clamour was raised
against it. The people were made to believe that
the Parl’t could not Levy any Tax (for so they
call y<sup>e</sup> Rates of Postage) here without the Consent
of the General Assembly. That, besides, all
their <i>Laws</i><a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> were exempted, because scarce any
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
came in here but what some way or other concern’d
Trade; That tho’ M’rs should, for the
reward of a penny a Letter, deliver them, the
Post M’r could Demand no Postage for the Conveyance
of them, and abundance more to the same
purpose, as rediculous as Arrogant.... Thereupon
a Bill is prepared and passed both Council
and Burg’s’s, w’ch, tho’ it acknowledges the Act
of Parliam’t to be in force here, does effectually
prevent its being ever put in Execution. The
first Clause of that Bill Imposes an Obligation on
the Post Master to w’ch he is no ways liable by
the Act of Parliament. The second Clause lays
a Penalty of no less than £5 for every Letter he
demands or takes from a Board any Ships that
stand Decreed to be excepted by the Act of Parliament;
and the last Clause appoints y<sup>e</sup> Stages
and the time of Conveyance of all Letters under
an Extravagant Penalty. As it is impossible for
the Post Master to know whether the Letters he
receives be excepted or not, and y’t, according to
the Interpreters, Our Judges of the Act of Parl’t,
all Letters sent from any Merch’t, whether the
same relate to Merchandize on board or not, are
within the exception of the Law, the Post M’r
must meddle w’th no Letters at all, or run the
hazard of being ruin’d. And the last Clause,
besides its Contradiction to the Act of Parliament
in applying the Stages, w’ch is expressly
Bestowed to the Post Master according to the
Instruction of the Soveraign, is so great an impossibility
to be complyed w’th that, considering the
difficulty of passing the many gr’t Rivers, the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
Post M’r must be liable to the penalty of 20s. for
every Letter he takes into his care during the
whole Season of the Winter. From whence yo’r
Lo’ps may judge how well affected the Major part
of Our Assembly men are towards y<sup>e</sup> Collecting
this Branch of the King’s Revenue, and w’ll therefore
be pleas’d to Acquitt me of any Censure of
Refusing Assent to such a Bill.”<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a></p>

<div id="Appointment_of_parsons" class="sidenote">Appointment
of
parsons.</div>

<p>With an assembly so adroit and so stubborn, the
way of the postmaster was hard indeed. Another
source of irritation was the question as
to appointing parsons. In practice they
were appointed by the close vestries, but
the governor wished to appoint them himself. It
also appeared that the king’s ministers would like
to send a bishop to Virginia. On these questions
the worthy Spotswood got embroiled with eight
of the councilmen as well as with the burgesses,
and complained of being rather shabbily treated:
“When in Order to the Solemnizing his Maj’ty’s
Birth-day,<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a> I gave a publick Entertainment at my
House, all gent’n that would come were Admitted;
These Eight Counsellors would neither come to
my House nor go to the Play w’ch was Acted on
that occasion, but got together all the Turbulent
and disaffected Burg’s’s, had an Entertainment of
their own in the Burg’s House and invited all y<sup>e</sup>
Mobb to a Bonfire, where they were plentifully
Supplyed with Liquors to Drink the same healths
without as their M’rs did within, w’ch were chiefly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
those of the Council and their Associated Burg’s,
without taking any [more] Notice of the Gov’r,
than if there had been none upon the place.”<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a></p>

<div id="Beginning_of_continental_politics" class="sidenote">Beginning of

<p>In such disputes between the legislatures chosen
at home and the executive officials appointed beyond
sea, Virginia, like the sister colonies in their
several ways, was getting the kind of political education
that bore fruit in 1776. In Virginia the
appointment of clergymen over parishes, in Maryland
the forty per poll for a church to which only
one sixth of the people belonged, in Massachusetts
the perennial question of the governor’s salary,&mdash;all
these were occasions for disputes
about matters of internal administration
in which far-reaching principles were involved.
Other questions, like that of postage just
mentioned, showed that gradually but surely and
steadily a continental state of things was coming
on. From the Penobscot to the Savannah there
was a continuous English world, albeit a strip so
narrow that it scarcely anywhere reached inland
more than a hundred and fifty miles from the coast.
The work of establishing postal communication
throughout this region seemed to require some
continental authority independent of the dozen
local colonial legislatures. We see Parliament,
with the best of intentions, stepping in and exercising
such continental authority; and we see the
Virginians resisting such action, on the ground
that in laying the species of tax known as postage
rates Parliament was usurping functions which
belonged only to the colonial legislatures. Thus
did the year 1718 witness a slight presage of 1765.

France.</div>

<p>Nothing did so much toward bringing the several
colonies face to face with a great continental
situation as the struggle with France which began
with the expulsion of the Stuarts in 1689
and was not to be decided until seventy
years later, when Wolfe climbed the
Heights of Abraham. The destruction
of the Invincible Armada, a century before the
downfall of James II., had shown that Great
Britain was to belong to the Protestant Reformers;
the latter event had shown that she was not
to be won back to the Catholic Counter-Reformation
which, starting with the election of Paul IV.
in 1555, had gained formidable strength in many
quarters. At the beginning of the seventeenth
century, when the colony of Virginia was founded,
the France of Henry IV. was in sympathy with
England and hostile to Spain. Before the end of
that century the France of Louis XIV. had been
won over to the Counter-Reformation. The dethronement
of England’s Catholic king came
almost like a rejoinder to the expulsion of a million
Protestants from France. The mighty struggle
which then began was to determine whether North
America should be controlled by Protestantism and
Whiggery, or by the Counter-Reformation and the
Old Régime.</p>

<div id="The_Continental_Congress_of_1690" class="sidenote">The Continental

<p>The first notable effect wrought in English
America by the outbreak of hostilities
was the assembling of a Continental Congress
at New York in 1690, the first meeting
of that sort in America. The continental
aspects of the situation were not as yet apparent
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span>
save to a few prescient minds. The infant settlements
in Carolina hardly counted for much.
Virginia was too far from Canada to feel deeply
interested in the organization of resistance to the
schemes of Frontenac, and so the southernmost
colony represented in the first American Congress
was Maryland.</p>

<div id="Origin_of_the_Stamp_Act" class="sidenote">Origin of
the Stamp
Act.</div>

<p id="Different_views_of_Spotswood">It was not long, however, before the continental
aspects of the situation began to grow more conspicuous.
The reader will remember how, in 1708,
the government at Charleston, in an official report
on the military resources of the colony, laid stress
upon the circumstance that Carolina was a frontier
to all the English settlements on the mainland.
The occasion for this emphasis was the great European
war that broke out in 1701, when Louis
XIV. put his grandson, Philip of Anjou, on the
vacant throne of Spain. The alliance of Spain
with France threatened English America at both
ends of the line. The destruction of Deerfield
by an expedition from Canada in 1704, and the
attempt upon Charleston by an expedition from
Florida in 1706, were blows delivered by the common
enemy, Louis XIV., the persecutor of Huguenots,
the champion of the Counter-Reformation,
the accomplice of the Stuarts. From that moment
we may date the first dawning consciousness of a
community of interests all the way from Massachusetts
to Carolina. But it was only a few clear-headed
persons that were quick to understand the
situation. The average members of a legislature
were not among these; their thoughts were much
more upon the constituencies “to whom they owed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
their elections” than upon any wide or far-reaching
interests. Such of the royal governors as were
honest and high-minded men saw the situation
much more clearly, since it was their business to
look at things from the imperial point of view.
Especially such a man as Spotswood, a soldier of
noted ability, who had himself been scarred in
fighting the common enemy, could not fail to understand
the needs of the hour. His official letters
abundantly show his disgust over the froward and
niggardly policy that refused prompt aid to hard-pressed
Carolina.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> To sit wrangling over questions
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
of prerogative while firebrand and tomahawk were
devouring their brethren on the frontier! To our
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
valiant soldier such behaviour seemed fit only for
churls; while waiting for the danger to come upon
one, instead of marching forth to attack the danger,
was surely as impolitic as unchivalrous. So, without
waiting on the uncertain temper and devious
arguments of many-headed King Demos, the governor
hurried his men on board ship as fast as
he could enlist and arm them, well knowing that
in a “dangerous conjuncture” the more precious
minutes one loses, the more costly grow those that
are left. During half of the eighteenth century,
as the conflict with France was again and again
renewed, such experiences as those of Spotswood
with his burgesses were repeated in most of the
colonies, until the royal governors became profoundly
convinced that the one thing most needed
in English America was a Continental Government
that could impose taxes, according to some uniform
principle, upon the people of all the colonies for
the common defence. At the Albany Congress of
1754, when the war-clouds were blacker
than ever, Benjamin Franklin came forward
with a scheme for creating such a
central government for purely federal purposes.
That scheme would have inaugurated a Federal
Union, with president appointed by the crown; it
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
would have lodged the power of taxation, for continental
purposes, in a federal council representing
the American people; and it would have left with
the several states all governmental functions and
prerogatives not explicitly granted to the central
government. <span id="Franklins_tax_plan_failure">Had Franklin’s plan been adopted
and proved successful in its working, the political
separation between English America and English
Britain would not have occurred when it did, and
possibly might not have occurred at all.</span> But
Franklin’s plan failed of adoption just at the moment
when American politics were becoming more
completely and conspicuously continental than ever
before. In the presence of a gigantic war that
extended “from the coast of Coromandel to the
Great Lakes of North America,”<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> the need for a
continental government and the evils that flowed
from the want of it were felt with increasing
severity; the old difficulties which had beset honest
Spotswood were renewed in manifold ways; until,
when the war was over, Parliament, with the best
of intentions but without due consideration, undertook
in the Stamp Act to provide a
steady continental revenue for America.
When the Americans refused to accept
Parliament as their continental legislature, and, in
alliance with Pitt and his New Whigs, won a noble
victory in the repeal of the Stamp Act, a great
American question became entangled in British
politics, and a situation was thus created which
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
enabled the unscrupulous and half-crazy George
III. to force upon America the quarrel that parted
the empire in twain. Nowhere in history is the
solidarity of events, in their causal relations, more
conspicuous than in America during the eighteenth
century; and for this reason the disputes of the
royal governors with their refractory assemblies
are nearly always rich in political lessons.</p>

<div id="Attempts_to_cross_the_Blue_Ridge" class="sidenote">Spotswood
crosses the
Blue Ridge,
1716.</div>

<p>Looking back from the present time at Spotswood’s
administration, we find its incidents perpetually
reminding us that the colonies were already
entering upon that long period of revolution from
which they were not to emerge until the adoption
of our Federal Constitution. We never lose consciousness
of the French and Indian background
against which the events are projected. Toward
this vast dim background Spotswood set his face
in 1716, in his memorable expedition across the
Blue Ridge. For more than a century since the
founding of Jamestown had the beautiful
valley of the Shenandoah remained
unknown to Virginians. It was still
part of the strange, unmeasured wilderness that
stretched away to the remote shores which Drake
had once called by the name New Albion.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a> Some
of its most savage solitudes had in Spotswood’s
youth been traversed by the mighty La Salle, and
other adventurous Frenchmen kept up explorations
among freshwater seas to the northwestward,
where English and Scotch officials of the Hudson
Bay Company were beginning to come into contact
with them. What was to be found between those
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
freshwater seas and the Gulf of Mexico no Englishman
could tell, save that it had been found to
be solid land, and not a Sea of Verrazano.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a> So
much might Spotswood have gathered from reading
and from hearsay, but not through any work
done by Englishmen. In the early days, as we
have seen, Captain Newport had tried to reach the
mountains and failed.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a> In 1653 it was enacted
that, “whereas divers gentlemen have a voluntarie
desire to discover the Mountains and supplicated
for lycence to this Assembly, ... that order be
granted unto any for soe doing, Provided they go
with a considerable partie and strength both of
men and amunition.”<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> But nothing came of this
permission. In Spotswood’s time the very outposts
of English civilization had not crept inland
beyond tidewater. A strip of forest fifty miles or
more in breadth still intervened between the Virginia
frontier and those blue peaks visible against
the western sky. This stalwart governor was not
the man to gaze upon mountains and rest content
without going to see what was behind them. Especially
since the French were laying claim to the
interior, since they had for some time possessed the
Great Lakes, and since they had lately been busy
in erecting forts at divers remote places in the
western country,<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a> it was worth while for Englishmen
to take a step toward them by crossing the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
mountains.<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a> The expedition was extremely popular
in Virginia. <span id="Blue_Ridge_crossed">A party of fifty gentlemen,
with black servants, Indian guides,
and packhorses, started out toward the
end of August and made quite an autumn picnic of
it.</span> One can fancy what prime shooting it was in
the virgin forest all alive with the finest of game.
To wash down so much toothsome venison and
grouse, the governor brought along several casks
of native wines&mdash;red and white Rapidan, so to
speak&mdash;made by his Spottsylvania Germans; but
cognac and cherry cordial were not forgotten, and
champagne-corks popped merrily in the wilderness.
Crossing the Blue Ridge at Swift Run Gap,<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a> on
nearly the same latitude as Fredericksburg, the
party entered the great valley a little north of the
present site of Port Republic, and about eighty
miles southwest from Harper’s Ferry. The exploits
of Stonewall Jackson in 1862 have clothed
the region with undying fame. Spotswood called
the river the Euphrates, an early instance of the
vicious naming by which the map of the United
States is so abundantly disfigured, but happily the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
melodious native name of Shenandoah has held its
place. On the bank of that fair stream one of the
empty bottles was buried, with a paper inside declaring
that the river and all the soil it drained
were the property of the King of Great Britain.
Having thus taken formal possession of the valley,
the picnickers returned to their tidewater
homes.</p>

<div id="Knights_of_the_Golden_Horseshoe" class="sidenote">Knights of
the Golden
Horseshoe.</div>

<p>A letter of Rev. Hugh Jones, who preached in
Bruton Church, says that Spotswood cut the name
of George I. upon a rock at the summit of the
highest peak which the party climbed, and named
it Mount George, whereupon some of the gentlemen
called the next one Mount Alexander, in
honour of the governor. “For this expedition,”
says Mr. Jones, “they were obliged to provide a
great quantity of horseshoes, things seldom used in
the lower parts of the country, where there are few
stones. Upon which account the governor
upon their return presented each
of his companions with a golden horseshoe,
some of which I have seen, studded with valuable
stones, resembling the heads of nails, with this
inscription ... <i>Sic juvat transcendere montes.</i><a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a>
This he instituted to encourage gentlemen to venture
backwards and make discoveries and new settlements,
any gentleman being entitled to wear this
golden shoe that can prove his having drank [<i>sic</i>]
his Majesty’s health upon Mount George.”<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> In
later times this incident was called instituting the
order of Knights of the Golden Horseshoe.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span></p>

<div id="Spotswoods_view_of_the_situation" class="sidenote">Spotswood’s
view of the
situation.</div>

<p>Spotswood’s letters to the Lords of Trade, in
which he mentions this expedition to the mountains,
are testimony to the soundness of his military
foresight. In recent years, he says, the
French have built fortresses in such positions
“that the Brittish Plantations
are in a manner Surrounded by their
Commerce w’th the numerous Nations of Indians
seated on both sides of the Lakes; they may not
only Engross the whole Skin Trade, but may,
when they please, Send out such Bodys of Indians
on the back of these Plantations as may greatly
distress his Maj’ty’s Subjects here, And should
they multiply their settlem’ts along these Lakes,
so as to joyn their Dominions of Canada to their
new Colony of Louisiana, they might even possess
themselves of any of these Plantations they
pleased. Nature, ’tis true, has formed a Barrier
for us by that long Chain of Mountains w’ch run
from the back of South Carolina as far as New
York, and w’ch are only passable in some few
places, but even that Natural Defence may prove
rather destructive to us, if they are not possessed
by us before they are known to them. To prevent
the dangers w’ch Threaten his Maj’ty’s Dominions
here from the growing power of these Neighbours,
nothing seems to me of more consequence than
that now while the Nations are at peace, and while
the French are yet uncapable of possessing all
that vast Tract w’ch lies on the back of these
Plantations, we should attempt to make some Settlements
on y<sup>e</sup> Lakes, and at the same time possess
our selves of those passes of the great Mountains,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
w’ch are necessary to preserve a Communication
w’th such Settlements.”<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a></p>

<p>He goes on to say that the purpose of his late
expedition across the Blue Ridge was to ascertain
whether Lake Erie, occupying as it did a central
position in the French line of communication between
Canada and Louisiana, was easily accessible
from Virginia. Information gathered from Indians
led him to believe that it was thus accessible.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a>
He therefore proposed that an English
settlement should be made on the south shore of
Lake Erie, whereby the English power might be
thrust like a wedge into the centre of the French
position; and he offered to take a suitable body
of men across the mountains and reconnoitre the
country for the purpose of finding a site. As for
the expense of such an enterprise, the king need
not be concerned about it; for there was enough
surplus from quitrents in the colonial treasury to
defray it. One cannot read such a letter without
admiring the writer’s honest frankness, his clear
insight, his prudence, and his courage.</p>

<div id="Spotswoods_last_years" class="sidenote">Spotswood’s
last years.</div>

<p>But with all Spotswood’s virtues and talents,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
and in spite of his popularity, he fell upon the
same rock upon which Andros and Nicholson had
been wrecked: he quarrelled with Dr. Blair, who
tells us that “he was so wedded to his own notions
that there was no quarter for them that went not
with him.”<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> With a change of name, perhaps the
same might have been said of the worthy doctor.
The quarrel seems to have originated in the question
as to the right of appointing pastors, and
it ended, as Blair’s contests always ended, in the
overthrow of his antagonist. Nobody could stand
up against that doughty Scotch parson.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a> Spotswood
was removed from his governorship in 1722,
but continued to live in the Virginia which he
loved. As postmaster-general for the American
colonies, he had by 1738 got the mail running
regularly from New England as far south as James
River. It took a week to carry the mail
from Philadelphia to Williamsburg; for
points further south the post-rider started at irregular
intervals, whenever enough mail had accumulated
to make it worth while. In 1740 Spotswood
received a major-general’s commission, and was
about to sail in Admiral Vernon’s expedition
against Cartagena,<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a> when he suddenly died. He
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
was buried on his estate of Temple Farm, near
Yorktown. In later days the surrender of Lord
Cornwallis was negotiated in the house which had
sheltered the last years of this noble governor.<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a></p>

<div id="Gooch_and_Dinwiddie" class="sidenote">Gooch and Dinwiddie.</div>

<p>Spotswood was succeeded by Hugh Drysdale,
who died in 1726, and next came William Gooch,
another military Scotchman, quiet, modest, and
shrewd, who managed things for twenty-two
years, from 1727 to 1749, with
marked ability and success. After an interval,
Gooch was followed by Robert Dinwiddie, still
another Scotchman, who came in 1751 and staid
until 1758, and whose administration is the last
one that calls for mention in the present narrative.</p>

<div id="The_Scotch_Irish" class="sidenote">The Scotch-Irish.</div>

<p>The period of Gooch’s government was remarkable
for the development of the westward movement
prefigured in Spotswood’s expedition across
the Blue Ridge. This development occurred in a
way that even far-seeing men could not
have predicted. It introduced into Virginia
a new set of people, new forms of religion,
new habits of life. It affected all the colonies
south of Pennsylvania most profoundly, and did
more than anything else to determine the character
of all the states afterward founded west of the
Alleghanies and south of the latitude of middle
Illinois. Until recent years, little has been written
about the coming of the so-called Scotch-Irish to
America, and yet it is an event of scarcely less
importance than the exodus of English Puritans to
New England and that of English Cavaliers to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_391">391</span>
Virginia. It is impossible to understand the drift
which American history, social and political, has
taken since the time of Andrew Jackson, without
studying the early life of the Scotch-Irish population
of the Alleghany regions, the pioneers of the
American backwoods. I do not mean to be understood
as saying that the whole of that population
at the time of our Revolutionary War was Scotch-Irish,
for there was a considerable German element
in it, besides an infusion of English moving inward
from the coast. But the Scotch-Irish element was
more numerous and far more important than all
the others. A detailed account of it belongs especially
with the history of Pennsylvania, since that
colony was the principal centre of its distribution
throughout the south and west; but a brief mention
of its coming is indispensable in any sketch of
Old Virginia and Her Neighbours.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a></p>

<div id="Colonization_of_Ulster" class="sidenote">Colonization of Ulster by James I.</div>

<p id="flourishing_manufactures_in_Ulster">Who were the people called by this rather awkward
compound name, Scotch-Irish? The answer
carries us back to the year 1611, when James I.
began peopling Ulster with colonists from Scotland
and the north of England. The plan was to put
into Ireland a Protestant population that
might ultimately outnumber the Catholics
and become the controlling element in the
country. The settlers were picked men and women
of the most excellent sort. By the middle of the
seventeenth century there were 300,000 of them in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
Ulster. That province had been the most neglected
part of the island, a wilderness of bogs and
fens; they transformed it into a garden. They
also established manufactures of woollens and
linens which have ever since been famous throughout
the world. By the beginning of the eighteenth
century their numbers had risen to nearly a million.
Their social condition was not that of peasants;
they were intelligent yeomanry and artisans.
In a document signed in 1718 by a miscellaneous
group of 319 men, only 13 made their mark, while
306 wrote their names in full. Nothing like that
could have happened at that time in any other
part of the British Empire, hardly even in New
England.</p>

<p>When these people began coming to America,
those families that had been longest in Ireland
had dwelt there but for three generations, and
confusion of mind seems to lurk in any nomenclature
which couples them with the true Irish. The
antipathy between the Scotch-Irish as a group and
the true Irish as a group is perhaps unsurpassed
for bitterness and intensity. On the other hand,
since love laughs at feuds and schisms, intermarriages
between the colonists of Ulster and the
native Irish were by no means unusual, and instances
occur of Murphys and McManuses of
Presbyterian faith. It was common in Ulster to
allude to Presbyterians as “Scotch,” to Roman
Catholics as “Irish,” and to members of the English
church as “Protestants,” without much reference
to pedigree. From this point of view the
term “Scotch-Irish” may be defensible, provided
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
we do not let it conceal the fact that the people to
whom it applied are for the most part Lowland
Scotch Presbyterians, very slightly hibernicized in
blood.</p>

<div id="Civil_disabilities" class="sidenote">Ulster’s grievances.</div>

<p id="Legislation_against_the_Ulster_manufacturers">The flourishing manufactures in Ulster aroused
the jealousy of rival manufacturers in England,
who in 1698 succeeded in obtaining legislation
which seriously damaged the Irish linen and woollen
industries and threw many workmen out of
employment. About the same time it
became apparent that an epidemic fever
of persecution had seized upon the English church.
The violent reaction against the Counter-Reformation,
with the fierce war against Louis XIV., had
stimulated intolerance in all directions. The same
persecuting spirit which we have above witnessed
as making trouble for the Carolinas and Maryland
found also a vent in the severe disabilities inflicted
in 1704 and following years upon Presbyterians in
Ireland. They were forbidden to keep schools,
marriages performed by their clergy were declared
invalid, they were not allowed to hold any office
higher than that of petty constable, and so on
through a long list of silly and outrageous enactments.
For a few years this tyranny was endured
in the hope that it was but temporary. By 1719
this hope had worn away, and from that year,
until the passage of the Toleration Act for Ireland
in 1782, the people of Ulster kept flocking to
America.</p>

<div id="The_migration_of_Ulster_men_to_America" class="sidenote">The migration of Ulster men to America.</div>

<div class="sidenote">Scotch-Irish in the southwest.</div>

<p id="excited_the_jealousy_of_rival_manufacturers">Of all the migrations to America previous to the
days of steamships, this was by far the largest in
volume. One week of 1727 landed six ship-loads
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
at Philadelphia. In the two years 1773 and 1774
more than 30,000 came. In 1770 one
third of the population of Pennsylvania
was Scotch-Irish. Altogether, between
1730 and 1770, I think it probable that at least
half a million souls were transferred from Ulster
to the American colonies, making not less than one
sixth part of our population at the time of the
Revolution. Of these, very few came to New England;
among their descendants were the soldiers
John Stark and Henry Knox, and more lately the
great naturalist Asa Gray. Those who went to
Pennsylvania received grants of land in the western
mountain region. The policy of the government
was to interpose them as a buffer between the
expanding colony and the Indian frontier. Once
planted in the Alleghany region, they spread rapidly
and in large numbers toward the southwest
along the mountain country through the Shenandoah
Valley and into the Carolinas. At a later
time they formed almost the entire population of
West Virginia, and they were the men who chiefly
built up the commonwealths of Kentucky and Tennessee.
Among these Scotch-Irish were
the Breckinridges, Alexanders, Lewises,
Prestons, Campbells, Pickenses, Stuarts,
McDowells, Johnstons, and Rutledges; Richard
Montgomery, Anthony Wayne, Daniel Boone,
James Robertson, George Rogers Clark, Andrew
Jackson, Thomas Benton, Samuel Houston, John
Caldwell Calhoun, Stonewall Jackson. It was
chiefly Scotch-Irish troops that won the pivotal
battle at King’s Mountain, that crushed the Indians
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
of Alabama, and overthrew Wellington’s
veterans of the Spanish peninsula in that brief
but acute agony at New Orleans. When our Civil
War came these men were a great power on both
sides, but the influence of the chief mass of them
was exerted on the side of the Union; it held Kentucky
and a large part of Tennessee, and broke
Virginia in twain.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Settlement of the Shenandoah Valley.</div>

<p id="Settlement_of_the_Shenandoah_Valley">It was about 1730 that the Scotch-Irish began
to pour into the Shenandoah Valley. “Governor
Gooch was then dispensing the Valley
lands so freely and indiscriminately that
one Jacob Stover, it is said, secured
many acres by giving his cattle human names as
settlers; and a young woman, by dressing in various
disguises of masculine attire, obtained several
large farms.”<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> Small farms, however, came to be
the rule. The first Scotch-Irish settled along the
Opequon River; and their very oldest churches,
the Tuscarora Meeting-house near Martinsburg
and the Opequon Church near Winchester, are
still standing. The Germans were not long in following
them, and we see their mark on the map in
such names as Strasburg and Hamburg.</p>

<div id="Profound_effect_upon_Virginia" class="sidenote">Profound effect
upon
Virginia.</div>

<p>This settlement of the Valley soon began to work
profound modifications in the life of Old Virginia.
Hitherto it had been purely English and
predominantly Episcopal, Cavalier, and
aristocratic. There was now a rapid invasion
of Scotch Presbyterianism, with small farms,
few slaves, and democratic ideas, made more democratic
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
by life in the backwoods. It was impossible
that two societies so different in habits and
ideas should coexist side by side, sending representatives
to the same House of Burgesses, without
a stubborn conflict. For two generations there
was a ferment which resulted in the separation of
church and state, complete religious toleration, the
abolition of primogeniture and entails, and many
other important changes, most of which were consummated
under the leadership of Thomas Jefferson
between 1776 and 1785. Without the aid of
the Valley population, these beginnings of metamorphosis
in tidewater Virginia would not have
been accomplished.</p>

<div class="sidenote">Frontier
phase of democracy.</div>

<p id="Jefferson_found_in_them_his_most_powerful_supporters">Jefferson is often called the father of modern
American democracy; in a certain sense the Shenandoah
Valley and adjacent Appalachian
regions may be called its cradle. In that
rude frontier society, life assumed many
new aspects, old customs were forgotten, old distinctions
abolished, social equality acquired even
more importance than unchecked individualism.
The notions, sometimes crude and noxious, sometimes
just and wholesome, which characterized
Jacksonian democracy, flourished greatly on the
frontier and have thence been propagated eastward
through the older communities, affecting their
legislation and their politics more or less according
to frequency of contact and intercourse. Massachusetts,
relatively remote and relatively ancient,
has been perhaps least affected by this group of
ideas, but all parts of the United States have felt
its influence powerfully. This phase of democracy,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
which is destined to continue so long as frontier
life retains any importance, can nowhere be so well
studied in its beginnings as among the Presbyterian
population of the Appalachian region in the
eighteenth century.</p>

<div id="Lord_Fairfax_and_George_Washington" class="sidenote">Lord Fairfax and George Washington.</div>

<p>The Shenandoah Valley, however, was not absolutely
given up to Scotchmen and Germans; it was
not entirely without English inhabitants
from the tidewater region. Among these,
one specially interesting group arrests our
attention. At the northern end of the Valley was
a little English colony gathered about Lord Fairfax’s
home at Greenway Court, a dozen miles
southwest from the site of Winchester. We have
seen how Lord Culpeper, in relinquishing his proprietary
claims upon Virginia, had retained the
Northern Neck. This extensive territory passed
as a dowry with Culpeper’s daughter Catharine to
her husband, the fifth Lord Fairfax;<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> and in 1745
their son, the sixth Lord Fairfax, came to spend
the rest of his days in Virginia. There was much
surveying to be done, and the lord of Greenway
Court gave this work to a young man for whom he
had conceived a strong affection. The name of
Fairfax’s youthful friend was George Washington,
and it is impossible to couple these two names without
being reminded of a letter written a hundred
years before, in 1646, when Charles I. had been
overthrown and taken prisoner, and Henry Washington,
royalist commander at Worcester, still held
out and refused to surrender the city without authority
from the king. Thus wrote the noble commander
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span>
to the great General Fairfax, commander
of the Parliament army: “It is acknowledged by
your books, and by report of your own quarter,
that the king is in some of your armies. That
granted, it may be easy for you to procure his Majesty’s
commands for the disposal of this garrison.
Till then I shall make good the trust reposed in me.
As for conditions, if I shall be necessitated I shall
make the best I can. The worst I know and fear
not; if I had, the profession of a soldier had not
been begun nor so long continued by your Excellency’s
humble servant,&mdash;Henry Washington.”<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a></p>

<div id="Virginians_from_tidewater" class="sidenote">The Gateway of the West.</div>

<div id="Advance_of_the_French" class="sidenote">Advance of the French.</div>

<p>There is a ring to this letter which sounds not
unlike the utterance of that scion of the writer’s
family who was destined to win independence
for the United States. It is pleasant
to know that General Fairfax obtained
the order from King Charles and
granted most honourable terms to the brave Colonel
Washington. In the following century a member
of the house of Fairfax, in engaging the younger
Washington to survey his frontier estates, put him
into a position which led up to his wonderful
public career. For this advance of the Virginians
from tidewater to the mountains served to bring
on the final struggle with France. The wholesale
Scotch-Irish immigration was fast carrying Virginia’s
frontier toward the Ohio River, and making
feasible the schemes of Spotswood in a way
that no man would have thought of. Hitherto the
struggle with the house of Bourbon had been confined
to Canada at one end of the line and Carolina
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
at the other, while the centre had not been
directly implicated. In the first American Congress,
convened by Jacob Leisler at New York in
1690 for the purpose of concerting measures of
defence against the common enemy, Virginia (as
we have seen) took no part. The seat of war was
then remote, and her strength exerted at such a
distance would have been of little avail. But in
the sixty years since 1690 the white population of
Virginia had increased fourfold, and her wealth
had increased still more. Looking down
the Monongahela River to the point
where its union with the Alleghany makes the
Ohio, she beheld there the gateway to the Great
West, and felt a yearning to possess it; for the
westward movement was giving rise to speculations
in land, and a company was forming for the exploration
and settlement of all that Ohio country.
But French eyes were not blind to the situation,
and it was their king’s pawns, not the English,
that opened the game on the mighty chess-board.
French troops from Canada crossed Lake
Erie, and built their first fort where the
city of Erie now stands. Then they pushed forward
down the wooded valley of the Alleghany
and built a second fortress and a third. Another
stride would bring them to the gateway. Something
must be done at once.</p>

<div id="Washington_warning_from_encroaching_upon_English_territory" class="sidenote">George
Washington’s
first
appearance
in history.</div>

<p>At such a crisis Governor Dinwiddie had need
of the ablest man Virginia could afford,
to undertake a journey of unwonted difficulty
through the wilderness, to negotiate
with Indian tribes, and to warn the advancing
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span>
Frenchmen to trespass no further upon English
territory. As the best person to entrust with
this arduous enterprise, the shrewd old Scotchman
selected a lad of one-and-twenty, Lord Fairfax’s
surveyor, George Washington. History does
not record a more extraordinary choice, nor one
more completely justified.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>This year 1753 marks the end of the period when
we can deal with the history of Virginia by itself.
The struggle against France, so long sustained by
New York and New England, acquires a truly
Continental character when Virginia comes to take
part in it. Great public questions forthwith come
up for solution, some of which are not set at
rest until after that young land surveyor has
become President of the United States. With
the first encounter between Frenchmen and Englishmen
in the Alleghanies, the stream of Virginia
history becomes an inseparable portion of
the majestic stream in which flows the career of
our Federal Union.

The claim to the French crown set up by Edward III. in
1328 led to the so-called Hundred Years’ War, in the course of
which Henry VI. was crowned King of France in the church of
Notre Dame at Paris in 1431. His sway there was practically
ended in 1436, but the English sovereigns continued absurdly to
call themselves Kings of France until 1801.</p></div>

A few of the oldest Virginia counties, organized as such in
1634, had arisen from the spreading and thinning of single settlements
originally intended to be cities and named accordingly.
Hence the curious names (at first sight unintelligible) of “James
City County” and “Charles City County.”</p></div>

of military titles in the South, and he quotes from a

in Maryland (as also in Virginia and Carolina) your ears are astonished
at the number of colonels, majors, and captains that

In describing this affair I have relied chiefly upon the affidavits
from the records of Westmoreland County, reprinted by
Dr. L. G. Tyler, in his admirable <i>William and Mary College
Quarterly</i>, ii. 39-43. The affidavits were taken by Nicholas
Spencer and Richard Lee, son of the Richard Lee mentioned in
the preceding chapter. In Browne’s <i>Maryland</i>, p. 131, an attempt
is made to throw the blame for killing the envoys upon the
Virginians, but the affidavits seem to me trustworthy and conclusive.
It is not likely that there was or is any discernible difference
between human nature in Virginia and in Maryland,
and public opinion in both colonies condemned Truman’s conduct.</p></div>

For the picturesque details of this narrative I have followed
the well-known document found by Rufus King when minister
to Great Britain in 1803, and published by President Jefferson in
the <i>Richmond Enquirer</i> in 1804; since reprinted in Force’s <i>Tracts</i>,
vol. i., Washington, 1836, and in Maxwell’s <i>Virginia Historical
Register</i>, vol. iii., Richmond, 1850. The original manuscript was
written in 1705, and addressed to Robert Harley, Queen Anne’s
secretary of state, afterward Earl of Oxford. The writer
signs himself “T. M.,” and speaks of himself as dwelling in
Northumberland County and possessing a plantation also in Stafford
County, which he represented in the House of Burgesses.
From these indications it is pretty certain that he was Thomas
Mathews, son of Governor Samuel Mathews heretofore mentioned.
His account of the scenes of which he was an eye-witness
is quite vivid.</p></div>

T. M. goes on to remark that “the two chief commanders
... who slew the four Indian great men” were present among
the burgesses. This may seem to implicate Colonel Washington
and Major Allerton in the killing of the envoys; but T. M.’s
recollection, thirty years after the event, is of not much weight
when contradicted by the sworn affidavits above cited. The facts
that, while Truman was impeached in Maryland, no such action
seems to have been undertaken in Virginia against Washington
and Allerton, and that, after the governor’s strong words regarding
the slaying, the friendly relations between him and these
gentlemen continued, would indicate that their skirts were clean.</p></div>

Beverley (<i>History and Present State of Virginia</i>, London,
1705, bk. iv. p. 3) tells us that before 1680 the council and burgesses
sat together, like the Scotch parliament, and that the
separation occurred under Lord Culpeper’s administration; and
his statement is generally repeated by historians without qualification.
Yet here in 1676 we find the two houses sitting separately,
and the discussion cited shows that it had often been so
before; otherwise the sending of two councillors to sit with the
burgesses could not have been customary. Beverley’s date of
1680 was evidently intended as the final date of separation; not
as the date before which the two houses never sat separately, but
as the date after which they never sat together.</p></div>

 “It is still their boast that they are the descendants of Powhatan’s
warriors. A good evidence of their present laudable
ambition is an application recently made by them for a share in
the privileges of the Hampton schools. These bands of Indians
are known by two names: the larger band is called the Pamunkeys
(120 souls); the smaller goes by the name of the Mattaponies
(50). They are both governed by chiefs and councillors, together
with a board of white trustees chosen by themselves.” Hendren,

In 1656 a tribe called Ricahecrians, about 700 in number,
from beyond the Blue Ridge, had advanced eastward as far
as the falls of the James River, where they encountered and
defeated Hill and Totapotamoy. After this the Ricahecrians
may have retraced their steps westward; we hear no more of
them on the Atlantic seaboard.</p></div>

Sherwood to Sir Joseph Williamson, June 28, 1676, <i>Virginia
Magazine</i>, i. 171. Sherwood was a gentleman, probably educated
as a lawyer, who had been convicted of robbery in England and
pardoned through the intercession of Sir Joseph Williamson,
secretary of state. (As to gentlemen robbers, compare the reference
to Sir John Popham, above, vol. i. p. 81 of the present
work.) Sherwood became attorney-general of Virginia in 1677,
and was for thirty years an esteemed member of society.</p></div>

I leave this as it was first written a few years ago, and take
pleasure in adding to it the following quotation from Mr. Bruce:
“That the entire site of the town will not finally sink beneath
the waves of the river will be due to the measures of protection
which the National Government have adopted at the earnest
solicitation of the <i>Association for the Preservation of Virginia
Antiquities</i>. This organization is performing a noble and sacred
work in rescuing so many of the ancient landmarks of the state
from ruin, a work into which it has thrown a zeal, energy, and
intelligence entitling it to the honour and gratitude of all who
are interested in the history, not merely of Virginia, but of
America itself.” <i>Economic History of Virginia</i>, ii. 562.</p></div>

Alexander Graydon tells us that in his early days any jockeying,
fiddling, wine-bibbing clergyman, not over-scrupulous as to
stealing his sermons, was currently known as a “Maryland parson.”
Graydon’s <i>Memoirs</i>, Edinburgh, 1822, p. 102. This was in
Pennsylvania, and any sneering remark or phrase current in any
of our states with reference to its next neighbours is entitled to be
taken <i>cum grano salis</i>. But there was doubtless justification for
what Graydon says.</p></div>

 “Among the rest, she often told me how the greatest part of
the inhabitants of that colony came thither in very indifferent
circumstances from England; that, generally speaking, they were
of two sorts: either, 1st, such as were brought over by masters of
ships to be sold as servants; or, 2nd, such as are transported
after having been found guilty of crimes punishable with death.
When they come here ... the planters buy them, and they work
together in the field till their time is out.... [Then] they have
a certain number of acres of land allotted them by the country,
and they go to work to clear and cure the land, and then to plant
it with tobacco and corn for their own use; and as the merchants
will trust them with tools and necessaries upon the credit of their
crop before it is grown, so they again plant every year a little
more [etc.].... Hence, child, says she, many a Newgate-bird
becomes a great man, and we have ... several justices of the
peace, officers of the trained bands, and magistrates of the towns
they live in, that have been burnt in the hand.... You need
not think such a thing strange; ... some of the best men in the
country are burnt in the hand, and they are not ashamed to own
it; there’s Major &mdash;&mdash;, says she, he was an eminent pickpocket;
there’s Justice B&mdash;&mdash; was a shoplifter, ... and I could name
you several such as they are.” <i>Moll Flanders</i>, p. 66.</p></div>

The only specific mention which Professor Butler has been
able to find of a criminal sent to New England is that of Elizabeth
Canning, who was sent out for seven years under penalty of
death if she returned to England during that time. She was
brought to Connecticut in 1754, married John Treat two years
afterward, and died in Wethersfield in 1773. <i>American Historical

of the prisoners condemned for taking part in Monmouth’s rebellion,
1685, were sent to Virginia (see Bancroft, <i>Hist. of U. S.</i>
i. 471; Ballagh, <i>J. H. U. Studies</i>, xiii. 293). But an examination
of the lists shows that nearly all were sent to Barbadoes, and
probably none to Virginia. See Hotten, <i>Original Lists of Persons

Mr. Bruce has well said that in the seventeenth century the
white servant was “the main pillar of the industrial fabric” of
Virginia, and “performed the most honourable work in establishing
and sustaining” that colony. “There can be no doubt, as he
goes on to say, that the work of colonization which has been performed
by the people of England surpasses, both in extent and
beneficence, that of any other race which has left an impression
upon universal history, and the part the manual labourers have
taken in this work is not less memorable than the part taken by
the higher classes of the nation.” <i>Economic History of Virginia</i>,

In the absence of detailed specific knowledge it is unsafe to
base inferences upon the word “servant,” inasmuch as in the
seventeenth century it included not only menials but clerks and
apprentices, even articled students in a lawyer’s or doctor’s office,
etc. See <i>William and Mary College Quarterly</i>, i. 22; Bruce,

Before the Revolution this grievance had come to awaken
fierce resentment. A letter printed in 1751 exclaims: “In what
can Britain show a more sovereign contempt for us than by
emptying their gaols into our settlements, unless they would likewise
empty their offal upon our tables?... And what must we
think of those merchants who for the sake of a little paltry gain
will be concerned in importing and disposing of these abominable
cargoes!”&mdash;<i>Virginia Gazette</i>, May 24, 1751.</p></div>

At the famous meeting in the Tabernacle at New York, in
May, 1850, when Isaiah Rynders and his ruffians made a futile
attempt to silence Garrison, one of the speakers maintained “that
the blacks were not men, but belonged to the monkey tribe.”
<i>William Lloyd Garrison: the Story of his Life, told by his Children</i>,
iii. 294. Defenders of slavery at that time got much comfort
from Agassiz’s opinion that the different races of men had
distinct origins. It was perhaps even more effective than the
favourite “cursed be Canaan” argument.</p></div>

Bruce, <i>Economic History</i>, ii. 94. About 1854 (I am not quite
sure as to the date) it was reported in Middletown, Conn., that the
“horrid infidel,” Rev. Theodore Parker, had, on a recent Sunday
in the Boston Music Hall, brought forward sundry cats and
dogs and baptized them in the name of Father, Son, and Holy
Ghost!!! I shall never forget the chill of horror which ran through
the neighbourhood at this tale of wanton blasphemy. In 1867 I
found the belief in the story still surviving among certain persons
in Middletown with a tenacity that no argument or explanation
could shake. The origin of the ridiculous tale was as follows:
The famous abolitionist, Parker Pillsbury, made a speech in which
he quoted what the lady said to Godwyn, that “he might as well
baptize puppies as negroes.” In passing from mouth to mouth
the report of this incident underwent an astounding transformation.
First the speaker’s name was exchanged for that of another
famous abolitionist, the strong and lovely Christian saint,
Theodore Parker; and then the figure of speech was developed
into an act and clothed with circumstance. Thus from the true
statement, that Parker Pillsbury told a story in which an allusion
was made to baptizing puppies, grew the false statement that
Theodore Parker actually baptized cats and dogs. A great deal
of what passes current as history has no better foundation than this
outrageous calumny.</p></div>

Chesapeake Bay, says Rev. Francis Makemie, is “a bay in
most respects scarce to be outdone by the universe, having so
many large and spacious rivers, branching and running on both
sides; ... and each of these rivers richly supplied, and divided
into sundry smaller rivers, spreading themselves ... to innumerable
creeks and coves, admirably carved out and contrived by the
omnipotent hand of our wise Creator, for the advantage and conveniency
of its inhabitants; ... so that I have oft, with no small
admiration, compared the many rivers, creeks, and rivulets of
water ... to veins in human bodies.” <i>A Plain and Friendly
Perswasive</i>, London, 1705, p. 5. “One receives the impression
in reading of colonial Virginia that all the world lived in country-houses,
on the banks of rivers. And the Virginia world did live
very much in this way.” Miss Rowland’s <i>Life of George Mason</i>,

The Huguenots seem to have preferred a French wine, for
one of the first things they did (in 1704) was to “begin an essay
of wine, which they made of the wild grapes gathered in the
woods; the effect of which was noble, strong-bodied claret, of a
curious flavour.” Beverley, <i>History of Virginia</i>, London, 1705,
part iv. p. 46. This has the earmark of truth. American clarets
are to this day strong-bodied, with a curious flavour!</p></div>

There was much strong feeling and vehement writing on the
subject by those who were disgusted at the prevalent state of
things: “I always judged such as are averse to towns to be three
sorts of persons: 1. Fools, who cannot, neither will see their own
interest and advantage in having towns. 2. Knaves, who would
still carry on fraudulent designs and cheating tricks in a corner
or secret trade, afraid of being exposed at a public market. 3.
Sluggards, who rather than be at labour and at any charge in
transporting their goods to market, though idle at home, and
lose double thereby rather than do it. To which I may add a
fourth, which are Sots, who may be best cured of their disease
by a pair of stocks in town.” Makemie’s <i>Plain and Friendly

One often hears it said, of some old house or church in Virginia,
that it was built of bricks imported from England; but,
according to Mr. Bruce, all bricks used in Virginia during the
seventeenth century seem to have been made there. Bricks were
8 shillings per 1,000 in Virginia when they were 18s. 8¼d. in London,
to which the ocean freight would have had to be added. It
is not strange, therefore, that Virginia exported bricks to Bermuda.
As early as the Indian massacre of 1622 some of the
Indians were driven away with brickbats. See Bruce, <i>Economic
History</i>, ii. 134, 137, 142.</p></div>

Samuel Peters, a Tory refugee, published in London, in 1781,
an absurd “History of Connecticut,” in which he started the
story of the “Blue Laws” of the New Haven Colony, which
most people allude to incorrectly as “Blue Laws of Connecticut.”
These “Blue Laws” were purely an invention of the mendacious
Peters. There never were any such laws. See my <i>Beginnings of

convicts working out a term of penal servitude! Boucher’s <i>Thirteen

never safe to depend upon numbers and figures. In the present
case we may conclude that the number of such schoolmasters was
noticeable; we are not justified in going further.</p></div>

412, 419; ii. 861. For neglecting to “set up school” for the
year, a town would be presented by the grand jury of the county,
and would then try to make excuses. “In February, 1744, the
usual routine was repeated. The farmers were summoned ‘to
know what the Town’s Mind is for doing about a School for the
insuing year.’ The school of the previous year having cost £55
old tenor, which may have been equivalent to 55 Spanish dollars,
and it being necessary to raise this sum by a general taxation, the
Town’s Mind was for doing nothing; and not until the following
July did it consent to have a school opened.” Bliss, <i>Colonial
Times on Buzzard’s Bay</i>, p. 118.</p></div>

Of the numbers in <i>The Federalist</i>, 51 were written by Hamilton,
29 by Madison, and 5 by Jay. But the frame of government
which the book was written to explain and defend was not at all
the work of Hamilton, whose part in the proceedings of the Federal
Convention was almost <i>nil</i>. It was very largely the work of
Madison, and while <i>The Federalist</i> shows Hamilton’s marvellous
flexibility of intelligence, it is Madison who is master and Hamilton
who is his expounder.</p></div>

It is authoritatively stated in the <i>Virginia Magazine</i>, i. 347,
that from the time of the Company down to the time of the
Revolution, “there is no record of any duel in Virginia.” In the
thirteen volumes of Hening I find no allusion to duelling; for
the mention of “challenges to fight” in such a passage as vol. vi.
p. 80, clearly refers to chance affrays with fisticuffs at the gaming
table, and not to duels. Yet in 1731 Rodolphus Malbone, for
challenging Solomon White, a magistrate, “with sword and pistol,”
was bound over in £50 to keep the peace: see <i>Virginia
Magazine</i>, iii. 89.</p></div>

For riotous murder in the city of New York 21 negroes were executed
in 1712, several of whom were burned and one was broken
on the wheel; and again in 1741, in the panic over an imaginary
plot, 13 negroes were burned at the stake: see <i>Acts of Assembly,
New York</i>, ann. 1712; <i>Documents relating to Colonial History of

Prof. M. C. Tyler (<i>History of American Literature</i>, i. 90)
quotes a statement of Burk (<i>History of Virginia</i>, Petersburg,
1805, vol. ii. appendix, p. xxx.), to the effect that in Princess Anne
County a woman was once burned for witchcraft. But Burk
makes the statement on hearsay, and I have no doubt he refers to
Grace Sherwood, who between 1698 and 1708 brought divers and
sundry actions for slander against persons who had called her
a witch, but could not get a verdict in her favour! She was
searched for witch marks and imprisoned. It is a long way from
this sort of thing to getting burned at the stake! Mrs. Sherwood
made her will in 1733, and it was admitted to probate in 1741.
See <i>William and Mary College Quarterly</i>, i. 69; ii. 58; iii. 96, 190,
242; iv. 18.&mdash;There is a widespread popular belief that the victims
of the witchcraft delusion in Salem were burned; scarcely
a fortnight passes without some allusions to this “burning” in the
newspapers. Of the twenty victims at Salem, nineteen were
hanged, one was pressed to death; not one was burned. See
Upham’s <i>History of Witchcraft and Salem Village</i>, Boston, 1867,
2 vols.</p></div>

In Professor Rivers’s version of the story there was either no
general conspiracy or only a sudden one conceived after the murder
of Lawson. He suggests that “being fearful of the consequences”
of that act, the Indians “were hurried into the design of
a widespread massacre,” etc. <i>Early History of South Carolina</i>,
p. 253. It may be so. Questions relating to concert between Indian
tribes are apt to be hard to settle. I think, however, that in
this case the simultaneity of attack at distant points is in favour
of the generally accepted view of a conspiracy arranged before
Lawson’s death.</p></div>

the early instances of the extreme difficulty of obtaining money
from “whimsical” legislatures for the common defence, which in
later years led Parliament to the attempt to cure the evil by
means of the Stamp Act. Even in what he did accomplish on the
border, Spotswood had to depend upon voluntary contributions,
just as money was raised by Franklin in 1758 for the expedition
against Fort Duquesne, and by Robert Morris in the great crisis
of Washington’s Trenton-Princeton campaign.</p></div>

Boswell has a characteristic anecdote of Oglethorpe, who
was very high-spirited, but extremely sensible. When a lad of
nineteen or so, he was dining one day with a certain Prince of
Würtemberg and others, when the insolent prince fillipped a few
drops of wine into his face. “Here was a nice dilemma. To
have challenged him instantly might have fixed a quarrelsome
character upon the young soldier; to have taken no notice of it
might have been considered as cowardice. Oglethorpe, therefore,
keeping his eye upon the prince and smiling, ... said, ‘That’s
a good joke, but we do it much better in England,’ and threw a
whole glass of wine in the prince’s face. An old general, who
sat by, said, ‘Il a bien fait, mon prince, vous l’avez commencé,’
and thus all ended in good humour.” <i>Life of Johnson</i>, ed. Birkbeck
Hill, ii. 180.</p></div>

Exquemeling was sent to Tortuga in 1666, in one of the
Dutch West India Company’s ships, and on his arrival was sold
for thirty crowns into three years’ servitude. He says very
neatly: “Je ne dis rien de ce qui a donné lieu à mon embarquement,
suivi d’un si fâcheux esclavage, parce que cela seroit
hors de propos, et ne pourroit estre qu’ennuyeux.” He was
cruelly treated. After gaining his freedom he joined the buccaneers,
apparently because there was nothing else to do. He
went home in 1674 in a Dutch ship, “remerciant Dieu de
m’avoir retiré de cette miserable vie, estant la première occasion
de la quitter que j’eusse rencontré depuis cinq années.” Oexmelin,
<i>Histoire des Avanturiers</i>, Paris, 1686, i. 13; ii. 312. The
English version of his book is entitled “History of the Bucaniers
of America” (London, 1684). The Spanish version is known
as “Los Piratas.” Not only do the titles thus differ, but each
translator has added more or less material from other sources, in
order to exalt the fame of the rascals of his own nation.</p></div>

In writing to James Stanhope, secretary of state, Spotswood
says: “Such is the unaccountable temper of the People that they
have generally chosen for their Representatives Persons of the
meanest Estates and Capacitys in their Countys, And as if the
House of Burgesses were resolved to copy after the patern of
their Electors, of the few Gentlemen that are among them, they
have expelled two for having the Generosity to serve their Country
for nothing, w’ch they term bribery.” <i>Official Letters</i>, ii.
129. This reminds one of the language applied by Sherwood
and Ludwell to Bacon’s followers (see above, p. 102); and suggests
the presence among the burgesses of a considerable party
which felt it necessary to contend against aristocratizing tendencies.
To establish the principle that representatives might serve
without pay would tend to disqualify poor folk from serving in
that capacity.</p></div>

His feelings find temperate expression in his letters to the
Lords of Trade and to the secretary of state, James Stanhope;
<i>e. g.</i>, in October, 1712: “This Unhappy State of her Maj’t’s Subjects
in my Neighbourhood is y<sup>e</sup> more Affecting to me because I
have very little hopes of being enabled to relieve them by our
Assembly, which I have called to meet next Week.... No
arguments I have used can prevail on these people to make their
Militia more Serviceable;” and in July, 1715: “I cannot forbear
regretting y<sup>t</sup> I must always have to do w’th y<sup>e</sup> Representatives
of y<sup>e</sup> Vulgar People, and mostly with such members as are of
their Stamp and Understanding, for so long as half an Acre of
Land ... qualifys a man to be an Elector, the meaner sort of
People will ever carry y<sup>e</sup> Elections, and the humour generally
runs to choose such men as are their most familiar Companions,
who very eagerly seek to be Burgesses merely for the Lucre of
the Salary, and who, for fear of not being chosen again, dare in
Assembly do nothing that may be disrelished out of the House
by y<sup>e</sup> Common People.... However, as my general Success
hitherto with this sort of Assemblys is not to be Complained of,
and as I have brought them, in some particulars, to place greater
Trust in me than ever they did in any Governor before, and seeing
their Confidence in Me has encreased with their Knowledge of me,
I have great hopes to lead even this new Assembly into measures
that may be for the hon’r and safety of these parts of his Maj’t’s
Dominions.... Y<sup>e</sup> Assembly of No. Carolina has already faulted
their Governor for dispatching away to y<sup>e</sup> relief of his next
Neighbours a small reinforcement of Men, they alledging that
their own danger requir’d not to weaken themselves.... None
of y<sup>e</sup> Provinces on y<sup>e</sup> Continent have yet sent any Assistance of
Men to So. Carolina, except this Colony alone, and No. Carolina,
and by w’t I understand from Govern’r Hunter [of New York] I
am afraid they may be diverted from it, he writing me word
y<sup>t</sup> their Indians are grown very turbulent and ungovernable. We
are not here without our dangers, too, but yet I judg’d it best,
and y<sup>e</sup> readiest way to save ourselves, to run immediately to check
the first kindling Flames, and even to stretch a point to succour
Carolina with Arms and ammunition; and I made such dispatch
in y<sup>e</sup> first Succours of Men I sent thither y<sup>t</sup> they pass’d no more
than 15 days between the Day of y<sup>e</sup> Carolina Comm’rs coming to
me and y<sup>e</sup> day of my embarking 118 Men listed for their Service.
I have since sent another Vessel with 40 or 50 Men more; and
hope in a short time to have y<sup>e</sup> Complem’t raised w’ch this Government
has engag’d to furnish.... I need not offer, for my
justification, to wound his Maj’t’s Ears with particular relation of
the miserys his Subjects in Carolina labour under, and of y<sup>e</sup> Inhuman
butchering and horrid Tortures many of them have been
exposed to.” So in Oct. 1715: “Such was the Temper and Understanding
[of the House of Burgesses] that they could not be
reason’d into Wholesome Laws, and such their humour and principles
y<sup>t</sup> they would aim at no other Acts than what invaded
y<sup>e</sup> Prerogative or thwarted the Government. So that all their
considerable Bills Stopt in the Council.... On y<sup>e</sup> 8 of Aug’st ... they
plainly declar’d they would do nothing ... till they
had an Answer from his Maj’tie to their Address about the Quitt
rents. I need not repeat to you, S’r, what I have formerly represented
of the inconveniency a Governm’t without money is expos’d
to, especially in any dangerous Conjuncture.... The bulk of
the Ellectors of Assembly Men concists of the meaner sort of
People, who ... are more easily impos’d upon by persons who
are not restrain’d by any Principles of Truth or Hon’r from publishing
amongst them the most false reports, and have front enough
to assert for truth even the grossest Absurdities. [How well this
describes the blatant demagogues who thrive and multiply in the
cesspool of politics to-day, like maggots in carrion!] ... These
mobish Candidates always outbid the Gent’n of sence and Principles,
for they stick not to vow to their Electors that no consideration
whatever shall engage them to raise money, and some
of them have so little shame as publickly to declare that if, in
Assembly, anything should be propos’d w’ch they judg’d might
be disagreeable to their Constituents, they would oppose it, tho’
they knew in their consciences y<sup>t</sup> it would be for y<sup>e</sup> good of the
Country.” Spotswood’s <i>Official Letters</i>, ii. 1, 2, 124, 125, 130, 132,
164.</p></div>

He understood that from Swift Run Gap it was but three
days’ march to a tribe of Indians living on a river which emptied
into Lake Erie; also that from a distant peak, which was pointed
out to him, Lake Erie was distinctly visible; so he estimated the
total distance as five days’ march. The river route thus vaguely
indicated was probably down the Youghiogheny or the Monongahela
to the site of Pittsburgh, then up the Alleghany and so on
to the site of Erie, distant in a straight line about 300 miles from
Swift Run Gap. Braddock in 1755 was a month in getting over
less than one fourth of the actual route. But, in spite of the
false estimate, Spotswood’s general idea was sound.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org/license

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
